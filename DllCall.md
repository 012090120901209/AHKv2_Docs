# DllCall

Calls a function inside a DLL, such as a standard Windows API function.

``` Syntax
Result := DllCall("DllFile\Function" , Type1, Arg1, Type2, Arg2, "Cdecl ReturnType")
```

## Parameters {#Parameters}

\[DllFile\\\]Function

:   Type: [String](../Concepts.htm#strings) or
    [Integer](../Concepts.htm#numbers)

    The DLL or EXE file name followed by a backslash and the name of the
    function. For example: `"MyDLL\MyFunction"` (the file extension
    \".dll\" is the default when omitted). If an absolute path isn\'t
    specified, *DllFile* is assumed to be in the system\'s PATH or
    [A_WorkingDir](../Variables.htm#WorkingDir). Note that DllCall
    expects a path with backslashes (\\). Forward slashes (/) are not
    supported.

    *DllFile* may be omitted when calling a function that resides in
    User32.dll, Kernel32.dll, ComCtl32.dll, or Gdi32.dll. For example,
    `"User32\IsWindowVisible"` produces the same result as
    `"IsWindowVisible"`.

    If no function can be found by the given name, a \"W\" (Unicode)
    suffix is automatically appended. For example, `"MessageBox"` is the
    same as `"MessageBoxW"`.

    Performance can be dramatically improved when making *repeated*
    calls to a DLL by [loading it beforehand](#load).

    This parameter may also consist solely of an integer, which is
    interpreted as the address of the function to call. Sources of such
    addresses include [COM](#COM) and
    [CallbackCreate](CallbackCreate.htm).

    If this parameter is an object, the value of the object\'s `Ptr`
    property is used. If no such property exists, a
    [PropertyError](Error.htm#PropertyError) is thrown.

Type1, Arg1

:   Type: [String](../Concepts.htm#strings)

    Each of these pairs represents a single parameter to be passed to
    the function. The number of pairs is unlimited. For *Type*, see the
    [types table](#types) below. For *Arg*, specify the value to be
    passed to the function.

Cdecl ReturnType

:   Type: [String](../Concepts.htm#strings)

    The word *Cdecl* is normally omitted because most functions use the
    standard calling convention rather than the \"C\" calling convention
    (functions such as wsprintf that accept a varying number of
    arguments are one exception to this). Note that most object-oriented
    C++ functions use the *thiscall* convention, which is not supported.

    If present, the word *Cdecl* should be listed before the return type
    (if any). Separate each word from the next with a space or tab. For
    example: `"Cdecl Str"`.

    Since a separate \"C\" calling convention does not exist in 64-bit
    code, *Cdecl* may be specified but has no effect on 64-bit builds of
    AutoHotkey.

    *ReturnType*: If the function returns a 32-bit signed integer (Int),
    BOOL, or nothing at all, *ReturnType* may be omitted. Otherwise,
    specify one of the argument types from the [types table](#types)
    below. The [asterisk suffix](#asterisk) is also supported.

## Return Value {#Return_Value}

Type: [String](../Concepts.htm#strings) or
[Integer](../Concepts.htm#numbers)

DllCall returns the actual value returned by *Function*. If *Function*
is of a type that does not return a value, the result is an undefined
value of the specified return type (integer by default).

## Types of Arguments and Return Values {#types}

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Type                              | Description                       |
+===================================+===================================+
| Str                               | A string such as `"Blue"` or      |
|                                   | `MyVar`, or a                     |
|                                   | [VarRef](../                      |
|                                   | Concepts.htm#variable-references) |
|                                   | such as `&MyVar`. If the called   |
|                                   | function modifies the string and  |
|                                   | the argument is a naked variable  |
|                                   | or VarRef, its contents will be   |
|                                   | updated. For example, the         |
|                                   | following call would convert the  |
|                                   | contents of *MyVar* to uppercase: |
|                                   | `DllCall("                        |
|                                   | CharUpper", "Str", `*`MyVar`*`)`. |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If the function is designed to    |
|                                   | store a string longer than the    |
|                                   | parameter\'s input value (or if   |
|                                   | the parameter is for output       |
|                                   | only), the recommended approach   |
|                                   | is to create a                    |
|                                   | [Buffer](Buffer.htm), use the     |
|                                   | [Ptr](#ptr) type to pass it, and  |
|                                   | use [StrGet](StrGet.htm) to       |
|                                   | retrieve the string after the     |
|                                   | function returns, as in the       |
|                                   | [wsprintf example](#ExWsprintf).  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Otherwise, ensure that the        |
|                                   | variable is large enough before   |
|                                   | calling the function. This can be |
|                                   | achieved by calling               |

|                                   | tStrCapacity.htm)`(&MyVar, 123)`, |
|                                   | where 123 is the number of 16-bit |
|                                   | units (loosely referred to as     |
|                                   | characters) that *MyVar* must be  |
|                                   | able to hold. If the variable is  |
|                                   | not null-terminated upon return,  |
|                                   | an error message is shown and the |

|                                   | typically indicate that the       |
|                                   | variable\'s capacity was          |
|                                   | insufficient.                     |

|                                   | integer, use \"UInt\*\" or        |

|                                   | same as [\"Str\"](#str) because   |
|                                   | \"Char\*\" passes the address of  |
|                                   | an 8-bit number, whereas          |
|                                   | [\"Str\"](#str) passes the        |

|                                   | \"AStr\"), depending on the       |
|                                   | version of AutoHotkey. Similarly, |
|                                   | \"UInt\*\" passes the address of  |
|                                   | a 32-bit number, so should not be |
|                                   | used if the function expects an   |
|                                   | array of values or a structure    |
|                                   | larger than 32 bits.              |

## Errors {#error}

DllCall throws an [Error](Error.htm) under any of the following
conditions:

-   [OSError](Error.htm#OSError): The [HRESULT](#HRESULT) return type
    was used and the function returned an error value (as defined by the
    [FAILED
    macro](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/winerror/nf-winerror-failed)).
    `Exception.Extra` contains the hexadecimal error code.
-   [TypeError](Error.htm#TypeError): The *\[DllFile\\\]Function*
    parameter is a floating point number. A string or positive integer
    is required.
-   [ValueError](Error.htm#ValueError): The [return type](#types) or one
    of the specified [arg types](#types) is invalid.
-   [TypeError](Error.htm#TypeError): An argument was passed a value of
    an unexpected type. For instance, an
    [expression](../Variables.htm#Expressions) that evaluates to a
    number was passed to a string ([str](#str)) argument, a non-numeric
    string was passed to a numeric argument, or an object was passed to
    an argument *not* of type [Ptr](#ptr).
-   [Error](Error.htm): The specified *DllFile* could not be accessed or
    loaded. If no explicit path was specified for *DllFile*, the file
    must exist in the system\'s PATH or
    [A_WorkingDir](../Variables.htm#WorkingDir). This error might also
    occur if the user lacks permission to access the file, or if
    AutoHotkey is 32-bit and the DLL is 64-bit or vice versa.
-   [Error](Error.htm): The specified function could not be found inside
    the DLL.
-   [Error](Error.htm): The function was called but it aborted with a
    fatal exception. `Exception.Extra` contains the exception code. For
    example, 0xC0000005 means \"access violation\". In such cases, the
    thread is aborted (if [try](Try.htm) is not used), but any [asterisk
    variables](#asterisk) are still updated. An example of a fatal
    exception is dereferencing an invalid pointer such as NULL (0).
    Since a [Cdecl](#cdecl) function never produces the error described
    in the next paragraph, it may generate an exception when too few
    arguments are passed to it.
-   [Error](Error.htm): The function was called but was passed too many
    or too few arguments. `Exception.Extra` contains the number of bytes
    by which the argument list was incorrect. If it is positive, too
    many arguments (or arguments that were too large) were passed, or
    the call requires [CDecl](#cdecl). If it is negative, too few
    arguments were passed. This situation should be corrected to ensure
    reliable operation of the function. The presence of this error may
    also indicate that an exception occurred. Note that due to the x64
    calling convention, 64-bit builds never raise this error.

## Native Exceptions and A_LastError {#except}

In spite of the built-in exception handling, it is still possible to
crash a script with DllCall. This can happen when a function does not
directly generate an exception but yields something inappropriate, such
as a bad pointer or a string that is not terminated. This might not be
the function\'s fault if the script passed it an unsuitable value such
as a bad pointer or a [\"str\"](#str) with insufficient capacity. A
script can also crash when it specifies an inappropriate argument type
or return type, such as claiming that an ordinary integer yielded by a
function is an [asterisk variable](#asterisk) or [str](#str).

The built-in variable [A_LastError](../Variables.htm#LastError) contains
the result of the operating system\'s GetLastError() function.

## Performance {#load}

When making repeated calls to a DLL, performance can be dramatically
improved by loading it explicitly (*this is not necessary for a
[standard DLL](#std) such as User32 because it is always resident*).
This practice avoids the need for DllCall to internally call LoadLibrary
and FreeLibrary each time. For example:

    hModule := DllCall("LoadLibrary", "Str", "MyFunctions.dll", "Ptr")  ; Avoids the need for DllCall in the loop to load the library.
    Loop Files, "C:\My Documents\*.*", "R"
        result := DllCall("MyFunctions\BackupFile", "Str", A_LoopFilePath)
    DllCall("FreeLibrary", "Ptr", hModule)  ; To conserve memory, the DLL may be unloaded after using it.

Even faster performance can be achieved by looking up the function\'s
address beforehand. For example:

    ; In the following example, if the DLL isn't yet loaded, use LoadLibrary in place of GetModuleHandle.
    MulDivProc := DllCall("GetProcAddress", "Ptr", DllCall("GetModuleHandle", "Str", "kernel32", "Ptr"), "AStr", "MulDiv", "Ptr")
    Loop 500
        DllCall(MulDivProc, "Int", 3, "Int", 4, "Int", 3)

If DllCall\'s first parameter is a literal string such as `"MulDiv"` and
the DLL containing the function is ordinarily loaded before the script
starts, or has been successfully loaded with [#DllLoad](_DllLoad.htm),
the string is automatically resolved to a function address. This
built-in optimization is more effective than the example shown above.

Finally, when passing a string-variable to a function that will not
change the length of the string, performance is improved by passing the
variable [by address](StrPtr.htm) (e.g. `StrPtr(MyVar)`) rather than as
a \"[str](#str)\" (especially when the string is very long). The
following example converts a string to uppercase:
`DllCall("CharUpper", "`**`Ptr`**`", StrPtr(MyVar), "Ptr")`.

## Structures and Arrays {#struct}

A structure is a collection of *members* (fields) stored adjacently in
memory. Most members tend to be integers.

Functions that accept the address of a structure (or a memory-block
array) can be called by allocating memory by some means and passing the
memory address to the function. The [Buffer](Buffer.htm) object is
recommended for this purpose. The following steps are generally used:

1\) Call `MyStruct := Buffer(123, 0)` to allocate a buffer to hold the
structure\'s data. Replace `123` with a number that is at least as large
as the size of the structure, in bytes. Specifying zero as the last
parameter is optional; it initializes all members to be binary zero,
which is typically used to avoid calling NumPut as often in the next
step.

2\) If the target function uses the values initially in the structure,
call [`NumPut`](NumPut.htm)`("UInt", 123, MyStruct, 4)` to initialize
any members that should be non-zero. Replace `123` with the integer to
be put into the target member (or specify `StrPtr(Var)` to store the
address of a string). Replace `4` with the offset of the target member
(see step #4 for description of \"offset\"). Replace `"UInt"` with the
appropriate type, such as `"Ptr"` if the member is a pointer or handle.

3\) Call the target function, passing *MyStruct* as a Ptr argument. For
example, `DllCall("MyDll\MyFunc", "Ptr", MyStruct)`. The function will
examine and/or change some of the members. DllCall automatically uses
the address of the buffer, which is normally retrieved by using
`MyStruct.Ptr`.

4\) Use `MyInteger := `[`NumGet`](NumGet.htm)`(MyStruct, 4, "UInt")` to
retrieve any desired integers from the structure. Replace `4` with the
offset of the target member in the structure. The first member is always
at offset 0. The second member is at offset 0 plus the size of the first
member (typically 4). Members beyond the second are at the offset of the
previous member plus the size of the previous member. Most members \--
such as DWORD, Int, and [other types of 32-bit integers](#Int) \-- are 4
bytes in size. Replace `"UInt"` with the appropriate type or omit it if
the member is a pointer or handle.

See [Structure Examples](#ExStruct) for actual usages.

## Known Limitations {#limits}

When a variable\'s string address (e.g. `StrPtr(MyVar)`) is passed to a
function and that function alters the length of the variable\'s
contents, subsequent uses of the variable may behave incorrectly. To fix
this, do one of the following: 1) Pass *MyVar* as a [\"Str\"](#str)
argument rather than as a Ptr/address; 2) Call
[`VarSetStrCapacity`](VarSetStrCapacity.htm#neg1)`(&MyVar, -1)` to
update the variable\'s internally-stored length after calling DllCall.

Any binary zero stored in a variable by a function may act as a
terminator, preventing all data to the right of the zero from being
accessed or changed by most built-in functions. However, such data can
be manipulated by retrieving the string\'s address with
[StrPtr](StrPtr.htm) and passing it to other functions, such as
[NumPut](NumPut.htm), [NumGet](NumGet.htm), [StrGet](StrGet.htm),
[StrPut](StrPut.htm), and DllCall itself.

A function that returns the address of one of the strings that was
passed into it might return an identical string in a different memory
address than expected. For example calling `CharLower(CharUpper(MyVar))`
in a programming language would convert *MyVar*\'s contents to
lowercase. But when the same is done with DllCall, *MyVar* would be
uppercase after the following call because CharLower would have operated
on a different/temporary string whose contents were identical to
*MyVar*:

    MyVar := "ABC"
    result := DllCall("CharLower", "Str", DllCall("CharUpper", "Str", MyVar, "Str"), "Str")

To work around this, change the two underlined \"Str\" values above to
Ptr. This interprets CharUpper\'s return value as a pure address that
will get passed as an integer to CharLower.

Certain limitations may be encountered when dealing with strings. For
details, see [Binary Compatibility](../Compat.htm#DllCall).

## Component Object Model (COM) {#COM}

COM objects which are accessible to VBScript and similar languages are
typically also accessible to AutoHotkey via [ComObject](ComObject.htm),
[ComObjGet](ComObjGet.htm) or [ComObjActive](ComObjActive.htm) and the
built-in [object syntax](../Objects.htm#Usage_Objects).

COM objects which don\'t support
[IDispatch](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/oaidl/nn-oaidl-idispatch)
can be used with DllCall by retrieving the address of a function from
the virtual function table of the object\'s interface. For more details,
see [the example](#ExTaskbar) further below. However, it is usually
better to use [ComCall](ComCall.htm), which streamlines this process.

## .NET Framework {#dotnet}

.NET Framework libraries are executed by a \"virtual machine\" known as
the Common Language Runtime, or CLR. That being the case, .NET DLL files
are formatted differently to normal DLL files, and generally do not
contain any functions which DllCall is capable of calling.

However, AutoHotkey can utilize the CLR through [COM callable
wrappers](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/native-interop/com-callable-wrapper).
Unless the library is also registered as a general COM component, the
CLR itself must first be manually initialized via DllCall. For details,
see [.NET Framework
Interop](https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?t=4633).

    demonstration of how to use DllCall to make a network connection to
    a TCP/IP server and receive data from it.
-   The operating system offers standard dialog boxes that prompt the
    user to pick a font, color, or icon. These dialogs use structures
    and can be displayed via DllCall in combination with
    [comdlg32\\ChooseFont](https://learn.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/ms646914(v=vs.85)),
