# Long Paths

In general, programs are affected by two kinds of path length
limitations:

1.  Functions provided by the operating system generally limit paths to
    259 characters, with some exceptions.
2.  Code for dealing with paths within the program may rely on the first
    limitation to simplify the code, effectively placing another 259
    character limitation.

These limitations are often referred to as \"MAX_PATH limitations\",
after the constant `MAX_PATH`, which has the value 260. One character is
generally reserved for a null terminator, leaving 259 characters for the
actual path.

AutoHotkey removes the second kind in most cases, which enables the
script to work around the first kind. There are two ways to do this:

-   Long paths can be enabled for AutoHotkey and all other
    long-path-aware programs on Windows 10. Refer to the [Microsoft
    documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/fileio/naming-a-file#enable-long-paths-in-windows-10-version-1607-and-later)
    for details. In short, this enables most functions to transparently
    work with long paths, but requires Windows 10 version 1607 or later.
-   In many cases, prefixing the path with `\\?\` enables it to exceed
    the usual limit. However, some system functions do not support it
    (or long paths in general). See [Known Limitations](#limitations)
    for details.

## Long Path Prefix {#prefix}

If supported by the underlying system function, the `\\?\` prefix \--
for example, in `\\?\C:\My Folder` \-- increases the limit to 32,767
characters. However, it does this by skipping [path
normalization](https://learn.microsoft.com/archive/blogs/jeremykuhne/path-normalization).
Some elements of the path which would normally be removed or altered by
normalization instead become part of the file\'s actual path. Care must
be taken as this can allow the creation of paths that \"normal\"
programs cannot access.

In particular, normalization:

-   Resolves relative paths such as `dir\file.ext`{.no-highlight},
    `\file.ext`{.no-highlight} and `C:file.ext`{.no-highlight} (note the
    absence of a slash).
-   Resolves relative components such as `\..` and `\.`.
-   Canonicalizes component/directory separators, replacing `/` with `\`
    and eliminating redundant separators.
-   Trims certain characters, such as a single period at the end of a
    component (`dir.\file`{.no-highlight}) or trailing spaces and
    periods (`dir\filename . .`).

A path can be normalized explicitly by passing it to
[GetFullPathName](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-getfullpathnamew)
via the function defined below, before applying the prefix. For example:

    MsgBox "\\?\" NormalizePath("..\file.ext")

``` {filename="foo.ahk"}
NormalizePath(path) {
    cc := DllCall("GetFullPathName", "str", path, "uint", 0, "ptr", 0, "ptr", 0, "uint")
    buf := Buffer(cc*2)
    DllCall("GetFullPathName", "str", path, "uint", cc, "ptr", buf, "ptr", 0)
    return StrGet(buf)
}
```

A path with the `\\?\` prefix can also be normalized by this function.
However, in that case the working directory is never used, and the root
is `\\?\` (for example, `\\?\C:\..` resolves to `\\?\` whereas `C:\..`
resolves to `C:\`).

## Known Limitations {#limitations}

Even when the path itself is not limited to 259 characters, each
component (file or directory name) cannot exceed the hard limit imposed
by the file system (usually 255 characters).

These do not support long paths due to limitations of the underlying
system function(s):

-   [DllCall](../lib/DllCall.htm) (for *DllFile* and *Function*)
-   [DirCopy](../lib/DirCopy.htm)
-   [DirDelete](../lib/DirDelete.htm), unless *Recurse* is false
-   [DirMove](../lib/DirMove.htm), unless the R option is used
-   [FileCreateShortcut](../lib/FileCreateShortcut.htm)
-   [FileGetShortcut](../lib/FileGetShortcut.htm)
-   [FileRecycle](../lib/FileRecycle.htm)
-   [SoundPlay](../lib/SoundPlay.htm) (for this, the limit is 127
    characters)
-   [DriveSetLabel](../lib/DriveSetLabel.htm) and [DriveGet
    variants](../lib/Drive.htm) (except
    [DriveGetType](../lib/DriveGetType.htm))
-   Built-in variables which return special folder paths (for which long
    paths might be impossible anyway):
    [A_AppData](../Variables.htm#AppData),
    [A_Desktop](../Variables.htm#Desktop),
    [A_MyDocuments](../Variables.htm#MyDocuments),
    [A_ProgramFiles](../Variables.htm#ProgramFiles),
    [A_Programs](../Variables.htm#Programs),
    [A_StartMenu](../Variables.htm#StartMenu),
    [A_Startup](../Variables.htm#Startup) and Common variants,
    [A_Temp](../Variables.htm#Temp) and
    [A_WinDir](../Variables.htm#WinDir)

[SetWorkingDir](../lib/SetWorkingDir.htm) and
[A_WorkingDir](../Variables.htm#WorkingDir) support long paths only when
Windows 10 long path awareness is enabled, since the `\\?\` prefix
cannot be used. If the working directory exceeds MAX_PATH, it becomes
impossible to launch programs with [Run](../lib/Run.htm). These
limitations are imposed by the OS.

It does not appear to be possible to run an executable with a full path
which exceeds MAX_PATH. That being the case, it would not be possible to
fully test any changes aimed at supporting longer executable paths.
Therefore, MAX_PATH limits have been left in place for the following:

-   [ahk_exe](WinTitle.htm#ahk_exe)
-   The default script\'s path, which is based on the current
    executable\'s path.
-   Retrieval of the AutoHotkey installation directory, which is used by
    [A_AhkPath](../Variables.htm#AhkPath) in compiled scripts and may be
    used to launch Window Spy or the help file.
-   [WinGetProcessPath](../lib/WinGetProcessPath.htm).
-   [WinGetProcessName](../lib/WinGetProcessName.htm) (this
    theoretically isn\'t a problem since it is applied only to the name
    portion, and NTFS only supports names up to 255 chars).

Long [#Include](../lib/_Include.htm) paths shown in error messages may
be truncated arbitrarily.
