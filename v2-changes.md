## Language

### Legacy Syntax Removed

Removed literal assignments: `var = value`

Removed all legacy If statements, leaving only `if expression`, which
never requires parentheses (but allows them, as in any expression).

Removed \"command syntax\". There are no \"commands\", only [*function
call statements*](Language.htm#function-call-statements), which are just
function or method calls without parentheses. That means:

-   All former commands are now functions (excluding control flow
    statements).
-   All functions can be called without parentheses if the return value
    is not needed (but as before, parentheses cannot be omitted for
    calls within an expression).
-   All parameters are expressions, so all text is \"quoted\" and commas
    never need to be escaped. Currently this excludes a few directives
    (which are neither commands nor functions).
-   Parameters are the same regardless of parentheses; i.e. there is no
    output variable for the return value, so it is discarded if
    parentheses are omitted.
-   Normal variable references are never enclosed in percent signs
    (except with [#Include](lib/_Include.htm) and
    [#DllLoad](lib/_DllLoad.htm)). Use
    [concatenation](Variables.htm#concat) or [Format](lib/Format.htm) to
    include variables in text.
-   There is no comma between the function name and parameters, so
    `WinMove(, y)` = `WinMove , y` (x is omitted). A space or tab is
    required for clarity. For consistency, directives also follow the
    new convention (there must not be a comma between the directive name
    and parameter).
-   There is no percent-space prefix to force an expression. Unquoted
    percent signs in expressions are used only for double-derefs/dynamic
    references, and having an odd number of them is a syntax error.
-   Method call statements (method calls which omit parentheses) are
    restricted to a plain variable followed by one or more identifiers
    separated by dots, such as
    `MyVar.MyProperty.MyMethod "String to pass"`.

The translation from v1-command to function is generally as follows (but
some functions have been changed, as documented further below):

-   If the command\'s first parameter is an output variable and the
    second parameter is not, it becomes the return value and is removed
    from the parameter list.
-   The remaining output variables are handled like [ByRef
    parameters](#byref) (for which usage and syntax has changed), except
    that they permit references to writable built-in variables.
-   An exception is thrown on failure instead of setting ErrorLevel.
-   Values formerly returned via ErrorLevel are returned by other means,
    replaced with exceptions, superseded or simply not returned.

All control flow statements also accept expressions, except where noted
below.

All control flow statements which take parameters (currently excluding
the two-word Loop statements) support parentheses around their parameter
list, without any space between the name and parenthesis. For example,
`return(var)`. However, these are not functions; for instance,
`x := return(y)` is not valid. [If](lib/If.htm) and
[While](lib/While.htm) already supported this.

[Loop](#loop-sub-commands) (except [Loop *Count*](lib/Loop.htm)) is now
followed by a secondary keyword (Files, Parse, Read or Reg) which cannot
be \"quoted\" or contained by a variable. Currently the keyword can be
followed by a comma, but it is not required as this is not a parameter.
[OTB](lib/Block.htm#otb) is supported by all modes.

[Goto](lib/Goto.htm), [Break](lib/Break.htm) and
[Continue](lib/Continue.htm) require an unquoted label name, similar to
v1 (`goto label` jumps to `label:`). To jump to a label dynamically, use
parentheses immediately after the name: `goto(expression)`. However,
this is not a function and cannot be used mid-expression. Parentheses
can be used with Break or Continue, but in that case the parameter must
be a single literal number or quoted string.

Gosub has been removed, and labels can no longer be used with functions
such as [SetTimer](lib/SetTimer.htm) and [Hotkey](lib/Hotkey.htm).

-   They were redundant; basically just a limited form of function,
    without local variables or a return value, and being in their own
    separate namespace. Functions can be used everywhere that label
    subroutines were used before (even [inside other
    functions](Functions.htm#nested)).
-   Functions cannot overlap (but can be contained within a function).
    Instead, use multiple functions and call one from the other. Instead
    of A_ThisLabel, use function parameters.
-   Unlike subroutines, if one forgets to define the *end* of a
    function, one is usually alerted to the error as each `{` must have
    a corresponding `}`. It may also be easier to identify the bounds of
    a function than a label subroutine.
-   Functions can be placed in the auto-execute section without
    interrupting it. The auto-execute section can now easily span the
    entire script, so may instead be referred to as [global
    code](Language.htm#global-code), executing within the [auto-execute
    thread](Scripts.htm#auto).
-   Functions might be a little less prone to being misused as \"goto\"
    (where a user gosubs the current subroutine in order to loop,
    inevitably exhausting stack space and terminating the program).
-   There is less ambiguity without functions (like
    [Hotkey](lib/Hotkey.htm)) accepting a label or a function, where
    both can exist with the same name at once.
-   For all remaining uses of labels, it is not valid to refer to a
    global label from inside a function. Therefore, label lookup can be
    limited to the local label list. Therefore, there is no need to
    check for invalid jumps from inside a function to outside (which
    were never supported).

### Hotkey and Hotstring Labels

[Hotkeys](Hotkeys.htm) and non-autoreplace [hotstrings](Hotstrings.htm)
are no longer labels; instead, they (automatically) define a function.
For multi-line hotkeys, use braces to enclose the body of the hotkey
instead of terminating it with `return` (which is implied by the ending
brace). To allow a hotkey to be called explicitly, specify
`funcName(ThisHotkey)` between the `::` and `{` - this can also be done
in v1.1.20+, but now there is a parameter. When the function definition
is not explicit, the parameter is named ThisHotkey.

**Note:** Hotkey functions are [assume-local](Functions.htm#AssumeLocal)
by default and therefore cannot assign to [global
variables](Functions.htm#Global) without a declaration.

### Names

Function and variable names are now placed in a shared namespace.

-   Each function definition creates a constant (read-only variable)
    within the current scope.
-   Use `MyFunc` in place of `Func("MyFunc")`.
-   Use `MyFunc` in place of `"MyFunc"` when passing the function to any
    built-in function such as [SetTimer](lib/SetTimer.htm) or
    [Hotkey](lib/Hotkey.htm). Passing a name (string) is no longer
    supported.
-   Use `myVar()` in place of `%myVar%()` when calling a function by
    value.
-   To call a function when all you have is a function name (string),
    first use a [double-deref](Variables.htm#deref) to resolve the name
    to a variable and retrieve its value (the function object).
    `%myVar%()` now actually performs a double-deref and then calls the
    result, equivalent to `f := %myVar%, f()`. Avoid handling functions
    by name (string) where possible; use references instead.

Names cannot start with a digit and cannot contain the following
characters which were previously allowed: `@ # $`. Only letters,
numbers, underscore and non-ASCII characters are allowed.

**Reserved words:** Declaration keywords and names of control flow
statements cannot be used as variable, function or class names. This
includes `local`{.no-highlight}, `global`{.no-highlight},
`static`{.no-highlight}, `if`{.no-highlight}, `else`{.no-highlight},
`loop`{.no-highlight}, `for`{.no-highlight}, `while`{.no-highlight},
`until`{.no-highlight}, `break`{.no-highlight},
`continue`{.no-highlight}, `goto`{.no-highlight},
`return`{.no-highlight}, `switch`{.no-highlight}, `case`{.no-highlight},
`try`{.no-highlight}, `catch`{.no-highlight}, `finally`{.no-highlight}
and `throw`{.no-highlight}. The purpose of this is primarily to detect
errors such as `if (ex) break`.

**Reserved words:** `as`{.no-highlight}, `and`{.no-highlight},
`contains`{.no-highlight}, `false`{.no-highlight}, `in`{.no-highlight},
`is`{.no-highlight}, `IsSet`{.no-highlight}, `not`{.no-highlight},
`or`{.no-highlight}, `super`{.no-highlight}, `true`{.no-highlight},
`unset`{.no-highlight}. These words are reserved for future use or other
specific purposes, and are not permitted as variable or function names
even when unambiguous. This is primarily for consistency: in v1,
`and := 1` was allowed on its own line but `(and := 1)` would not work.

The words listed above are permitted as property or window group names.
Property names in typical use are preceded by `.`, which prevents the
word from being interpreted as an operator. By contrast, keywords are
never interpreted as variable or function names within an expression.
For example, `not(x)` is equivalent to `not (x)` or `(not x)`.

A number of classes are predefined, effectively reserving those global
variable names in the same way that a user-defined class would.
(However, the [changes to scope](#scope) described below mitigate most
issues arising from this.) For a list of classes, see [Built-in
Classes](ObjList.htm).

### Scope

*Super-global* variables have been removed (excluding built-in
variables, which aren\'t quite the same as they cannot be redeclared or
shadowed).

Within an [assume-local](Functions.htm#AssumeLocal) function, if a given
name is not used in a declaration or as the target of a non-dynamic
assignment or the [reference (&) operator](Variables.htm#ref), it may
resolve to an existing global variable.

In other words:

-   Functions can now read global variables without declaring them.
-   Functions which have no `global` declarations cannot directly modify
    global variables (eliminating one source of unintended
    side-effects).
-   Adding a new `class` to the script is much less likely to affect the
    behaviour of any existing function, as classes are not super-global.
-   The `global` keyword is currently redundant when used in global
    scope, but can be used for clarity. Variables declared this way are
    now much less likely to conflict with local variables (such as when
    combining scripts manually or with [#Include](lib/_Include.htm)), as
    they are not super-global. On the other hand, some convenience is
    lost.
-   Declarations are generally not needed as much.

*Force-local* mode has been removed.

### Variables

Local [static](Functions.htm#static) variables are initialized if and
when execution reaches them, instead of being executed in linear order
before the auto-execute section begins. Each initializer has no effect
the second time it is reached. Multiple declarations are permitted and
may execute for the same variable at different times. There are multiple
benefits:

-   When a static initializer calls other functions with static
    variables, there is less risk of initializers having not executed
    yet due to the order of the function definitions.
-   Because the function has been called, parameters,
    [A_ThisFunc](Variables.htm#ThisFunc) and
    [closures](Functions.htm#closures) are available (they previously
    were not).
-   A static variable can be initialized conditionally, adding
    flexibility, while still only executing once without requiring
    `if IsSet()`.
-   Since there may be multiple initializers for a single static
    variable, compound assignments such as `static x += 1` are
    permitted. (This change reduced code size marginally as it was
    already permitted by `local` and `global`.)

**Note:** `static init := somefunction()` can no longer be used to
auto-execute *somefunction*. However, since label-and-return based
subroutines can now be completely avoided, the auto-execute section is
able to span the entire script.

Declaring a variable with `local` no longer makes the function
[assume-global](Functions.htm#AssumeGlobal).

[Double-derefs](Variables.htm#deref) are now more consistent with
variables resolved at load-time, and are no longer capable of creating
new variables. This avoids some inconsistencies and common points of
confusion.

Double-derefs which fail for any reason now cause an error to be thrown.
Previously any cases with an invalid name would silently produce an
empty string, while other cases would create and return an empty
variable.

### Expressions

Quoted literal strings can be written with `"double"` or `'single'`
quote marks, but must begin and end with the same mark. Literal quote
marks are written by preceding the mark with an escape character -
`` `" `` or `` `' `` - or by using the opposite type of quote mark:
`'"42" is the answer'`. Doubling the quote marks has no special meaning,
and causes an error since auto-concat requires a space.

The operators `&&`, `||`, `and` and `or` yield whichever value
determined the result, similar to JavaScript and Lua. For example,
`"" or "default"` yields \"default\" instead of 1. Scripts which require
a pure boolean value (0 or 1) can use something like `!!(x or y)` or
`(x or y) ? 1 : 0`.

Auto-concat now requires at least one space or tab in all cases (the v1
documentation says there \"should be\" a space).

The result of a multi-statement expression such as `x(), y()` is the
last (right-most) sub-expression instead of the first (left-most)
sub-expression. In both v1 and v2, the sub-expressions are evaluated in
left to right order.

Equals after a comma is no longer assignment: `y=z` in `x:=y, y=z` is an
ineffectual comparison instead of an assignment.

`:=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `++` and `--` have consistent behaviour
regardless of whether they are used on their own or combined with other
operators, such as with `x := y, y += 2`. Previously, there were
differences in behaviour when an error occurred within the expression or
a blank value was used in a math operation.

`!=` is now always case-insensitive, like `=`, while `!==` has been
added as the counterpart of `==`.

`<>` has been removed.

`//` now throws an exception if given a floating-point number.
Previously the results were inconsistent between negative floats and
negative integers.

`|`, `^`, `&`, `<<` and `>>` now throw an exception if given a
floating-point number, instead of truncating to integer.

Scientific notation can be used without a decimal point (but produces a
floating-point number anyway). Scientific notation is also supported
when numeric strings are converted to integers (for example, `"1e3"` is
interpreted as 1000 instead of 1).

Function calls now permit virtually any sub-expression for specifying
which function to call, provided that there is no space or tab before
the open-parenthesis of the parameter list. For example, `MyFunc()`
would call the value of *MyFunc* regardless of whether that is the
function\'s actual name or a variable containing a function object, and
`(a?b:c)()` would call either *b* or *c* depending on *a*. Note that
`x.y()` is still a method call roughly equivalent to `(x.y)(x)`, but
`a[i]()` is now equivalent to `(a[i])()`.

Double-derefs now permit almost any expression (not just variables) as
the source of the variable name. For example, `DoNotUseArray%n+1%` and
`%(%triple%)%` are valid. Double-deref syntax is now also used to
dereference VarRefs, such as `ref := &var, value := %ref%`.

The expressions `funcName[""]()` and `funcName.()` no longer call a
function by name. Omitting the method name as in `.()` now causes a
load-time error message. Functions should be called or handled by
reference, not by name.

`var :=` with no r-value is treated as an error at load-time. In v1 it
was equivalent to `var := ""`, but silently failed if combined with
another expression - for example: `x :=, y :=`.

Where a literal string is followed by an ambiguous unary/binary
operator, an error is reported at load-time. For instance,
`"new counter:" ++Counter` is probably supposed to increment and display
*Counter*, but technically it is invalid addition and unary plus.

`word ++` and `word --` are no longer expressions, since `word` can be a
user-defined function (and ++/\-- may be followed by an expression which
produces a variable reference). To write a standalone post-increment or
post-decrement expression, either omit the space between the variable
and the operator, or wrap the variable or expression in parentheses.

`word ? x : y` is still a ternary expression, but more complex cases
starting with a word, such as `word1 word2 ? x : y`, are always
interpreted as function calls to *word1* (even if no such function
exists). To write a standalone ternary expression with a complex
condition, enclose the condition in parentheses.

The new [`is` operator](Variables.htm#is) such as in `x is y` can be
used to check whether value *x* is an instance of class *y*, where *y*
must be an Object with a *Prototype* property (i.e. a
[Class](lib/Class.htm)). This includes primitive values, as in
`x is Integer` (which is strictly a type check, whereas `IsInteger(x)`
checks for potential conversion).

Keywords `contains` and `in` are reserved for future use.

`&var` (address-of) has been replaced with `StrPtr(var)` and
`ObjPtr(obj)` to more clearly show the intent and enhance error
checking. In v1, address-of returned the address of *var*\'s internal
string buffer, even if it contained a number (but not an object). It was
also used to retrieve the address of an object, and getting an address
of the wrong type can have dire consequences.

`&var` is now the [reference operator](Variables.htm#ref), which is used
with all [ByRef](#byref) and OutputVar parameters to improve clarity and
flexibility (and make other language changes possible). See [Variable
References (VarRef)](Concepts.htm#variable-references) for more details.

String length is now cached during expression evaluation. This improves
performance and allows strings to contain binary zero. In particular:

-   Concatenation of two strings where one or both contain binary zero
    no longer causes truncation of the data.
-   The case-sensitive equality operators (`==` and `!==`) can be used
    to compare binary data. The other comparison operators only \"see\"
    up to the first binary zero.
-   Binary data can be returned from functions and assigned to objects.

Most functions still expect null-terminated strings, so will only
\"see\" up to the first binary zero. For example,
[MsgBox](lib/MsgBox.htm) would display only the portion of the string
before the first binary zero.

The `*` (deref) operator has been removed. Use [NumGet](lib/NumGet.htm)
instead.

The `~` ([bitwise-NOT](Variables.htm#unary)) operator now always treats
its input as a 64-bit signed integer; it no longer treats values between
0 and 4294967295 as unsigned 32-bit.

`>>>` and `>>>=` have been added for logical right bit shift.

Added [fat arrow functions](Variables.htm#fat-arrow). The expression
`Fn(Parameters) => Expression` defines a function named *Fn* (which can
be blank) and returns a [Func object](lib/Func.htm) or [Closure
object](Functions.htm#closures). When called, the function evaluates
*Expression* and returns the result. When used inside another function,
*Expression* can refer to the outer function\'s variables (this can also
be done with a normal function definition).

The fat arrow syntax can also be used to define methods and property
getters/setters (in which case the method/property definition itself
isn\'t an expression, but its body just returns an expression).

Literal numbers are now fully supported on the left-hand side of member
access (dot). For example, `0.1` is a number but `0.min`{.no-highlight}
and `0.1.min`{.no-highlight} access the *min* property which can be
handled by a base object (see [Primitive
Values](Objects.htm#primitive)). `1..2`{.no-highlight} or
`1.0.2`{.no-highlight} is the number 1.0 followed by the property 2.
Example use might be to implement units of measurement, literal version
numbers or ranges.

`x**y`: Where *x* and *y* are integers and *y* is positive, the power
operator now gives correct results for all inputs if in range, where
previously some precision was lost due to the internal use of
floating-point math. Behaviour of overflow is undefined.

### Objects (Misc)

See also: [Objects](#objects)

There is now a distinction between properties accessed with `.` and data
(items, array or map elements) accessed with `[]`. For example,
`dictionary["Count"]` can return the definition of \"Count\" while
`dictionary.Count` returns the number of words contained within.
User-defined objects can utilize this by defining an [\_\_Item
property](Objects.htm#__Item).

When the name of a property or method is not known in advance, it can
(and must) be accessed by using percent signs. For example,
`obj.%varname%()` is the v2 equivalent of `obj[varname]()`. The use of
`[]` is reserved for data (such as array elements).

The literal syntax for constructing an ad hoc object is still basically
`{name: value}`, but since plain objects now only have \"properties\"
and not \"array elements\", the rules have changed slightly for
consistency with how properties are accessed in other contexts:

-   `o := {a: b}` uses the name \"a\", as before.
-   `o := {%a%: b}` uses the property name in *a*, instead of taking
    that as a variable name, performing a double-deref, and using the
    contents of the resulting variable. In other words, it has the same
    effect as `o := {}, o.%a% := b`.
-   Any other kind of expression to the left of `:` is illegal. For
    instance, `{(a): b}` or `{an error: 1}`.

The use of the word \"base\" in `base.Method()` has been replaced with
[super](Objects.htm#Custom_Classes_super) (`super.Method()`) to
distinguish the two concepts better:

-   `super.` or `super[` calls the super-class version of a
    method/property, where \"super-class\" is the base of the prototype
    object which was originally associated with the current function\'s
    definition.
-   `super` is a reserved word; attempting to use it without the `.` or
    `[` or `(` suffix or outside of a class results in a load time
    error.
-   `base` is a pre-defined property which gets or sets the object\'s
    immediate base object (like
    [ObjGetBase](lib/Any.htm#GetBase)/[ObjSetBase](lib/Object.htm#SetBase)).
    It is just a normal property name, not reserved.
-   Invoking `super.x` when the superclass has no definition of x throws
    an error, whereas `base.x` was previously ignored (even if it was an
    assignment).

Calling a user-defined object without explicitly specifying a method
name now results in a call to the \"Call\" method instead of the \"\"
method. For example, `%Fn%()` previously resulted in a call to `Fn.()`,
but the v2 expression `Fn()` results in a call to `Fn.Call()`.
[Func](lib/Func.htm) objects no longer implement the nameless method. It
is no longer valid to omit the method name in a method call, but
`Fn.%""%()` works in place of `Fn.()`.

`this.Method()` calls `Fn.Call(this)` (where *Fn* is the function object
which implements the method) instead of `Fn[this]()` (which in v1, would
result in a call to `Fn.__Call(this)` unless `Fn[this]` contains a
function). Function objects should implement a *Call* method instead of
*\_\_Call*, which is only for explicit method calls.

*`Classname`*`()` (formerly `new `*`Classname`*`()`) now fails to create
the object if the *\_\_New* method is defined and it could not be called
(e.g. because the parameter count is incorrect), or if parameters were
passed and *\_\_New* is not defined.

Objects created within an expression or returned from a function are now
held until expression evaluation is complete, and then released. This
improves performance slightly and allows temporary objects to be used
for memory management within an expression, without fear of the objects
being freed prematurely.

Objects can contain string values (but not keys) which contain binary
zero. Cloning an object preserves binary data in strings, up to the
stored length of the string (not its capacity). Historically, data was
written beyond the value\'s length when dealing with binary data or
structs; now, a [Buffer object](lib/Buffer.htm) should be used instead.

Assignment expressions such as `x.y := z` now always yield the value of
*z*, regardless of how *x.y* is implemented. The return value of a
property setter is now ignored. Previously:

-   Some built-in objects returned *z*, some returned *x.y* (such as
    `c := GuiObj.BackColor := "red"` setting *c* to 0xFF0000), and some
    returned an incorrect value.
-   User-defined property setters may have returned unexpected values or
    failed to return anything.

`x.y(z) := v` is now a syntax error. It was previously equivalent to
`x.y[z] := v`. In general, `x.y(z)` (method call) and `x.y[z]`
(parameterized property) are two different operations, although they may
be equivalent if *x* is a COM object (due to limitations of the COM
interface).

Concatenating an object with another value or passing it to
[Loop](lib/Loop.htm) is currently treated as an error, whereas
previously the object was treated as an empty string. This may be
changed to implicitly call `.ToString()`. Use `String(x)` to convert a
value to a string; this calls `.ToString()` if *x* is an object.

When an object is called via IDispatch (the COM interface), any uncaught
exceptions which cannot be passed back to the caller will cause an error
dialog. (The caller may or may not show an additional error dialog
without any specific details.) This also applies to event handlers being
called due to the use of [ComObjConnect](lib/ComObjConnect.htm).

### Functions

Functions can no longer be dynamically called with more parameters than
they formally accept.

[Variadic functions](Functions.htm#Variadic) are not affected by the
above restriction, but normally will create an array each time they are
called to hold the surplus parameters. If this array is not needed, the
parameter name can now be omitted to prevent it from being created:

    AcceptsOneOrMoreArgs(first, *) {
      ...
    }

This can be used for callbacks where the additional parameters are not
needed.

[Variadic function calls](Functions.htm#VariadicCall) now permit any
enumerable object, where previously they required a standard Object with
sequential numeric keys. If the enumerator returns more than one value
per iteration, only the first value is used. For example,
`Array(mymap*)` creates an array containing the keys of *mymap*.

Variadic function calls previously had half-baked support for named
parameters. This has been disabled, to remove a possible impediment to
the proper implementation of named parameters.

User-defined functions may use the new keyword `unset` as a parameter
default value to make the parameter \"unset\" when no value was
provided. The function can then use IsSet() to determine if a value was
provided. `unset` is currently not permitted in any other context.

Scripts are no longer automatically included from the function library
(Lib) folders when a function call is present without a definition, due
to increased complexity and potential for accidents (now that the
*MyFunc* in `MyFunc()` can be any variable). `#Include <LibName>` works
as before. It may be superseded by module support in a future release.

Variadic built-in functions now have a *MaxParams* value equal to
*MinParams*, rather than an arbitrary number (such as 255 or 10000). Use
the *IsVariadic* property to detect when there is no upper bound.

#### ByRef

[ByRef parameters](Functions.htm#ByRef) are now declared using `&param`
instead of `ByRef param`, with some differences in usage.

ByRef parameters no longer implicitly take a reference to the caller\'s
variable. Instead, the caller must explicitly pass a reference with the
[reference operator](Variables.htm#ref) (`&var`). This allows more
flexibility, such as storing references elsewhere, accepting them with a
variadic function and passing them on with a variadic call.

When a parameter is marked ByRef, any attempt to explicitly pass a
non-VarRef value causes an error to be thrown. Otherwise, the function
can check for a reference with `param is VarRef`, check if the target
variable has a value with `IsSetRef(param)`, and explicitly dereference
it with `%param%`.

ByRef parameters are now able to receive a reference to a local variable
from a previous instance of the same function, when it is called
recursively.

### Nested Functions

One function may be defined inside another. A nested function may
automatically \"capture\" non-static local variables from the enclosing
function (under the right conditions), allowing them to be used after
the enclosing function returns.

The new \"fat arrow\" `=>` operator can also be used to create nested
functions.

For full detail, see [Nested Functions](Functions.htm#nested).

### Uncategorized

`:=` must be used in place of `=` when initializing a declared variable
or optional parameter.

`return %var%` now does a double-deref; previously it was equivalent to
`return var`.

[#Include](lib/_Include.htm) is relative to the directory containing the
current file by default. Its parameter may now optionally be enclosed in
quote marks.

[#ErrorStdOut](lib/_ErrorStdOut.htm)\'s parameter may now optionally be
enclosed in quote marks.

Label names are now required to consist only of letters, numbers,
underscore and non-ASCII characters (the same as variables, functions,
etc.).

Labels defined in a function have local scope; they are visible only
inside that function and do not conflict with labels defined elsewhere.
It is not possible for local labels to be called externally (even by
built-in functions). Nested functions can be used instead, allowing full
use of local variables.

`for k, v in obj`:

-   How the object is invoked has changed. See
    [Enumeration](#enumeration) further below.
-   *k* and *v* are now restored to the values they had before the loop
    began, after the loop breaks or completes.
-   An exception is thrown if *obj* is not an object or there is a
    problem retrieving or calling its enumerator.
-   Up to 19 variables can be used.
-   Variables can be omitted.

Escaping a comma no longer has any meaning. Previously if used in an
expression within a command\'s parameter and not within parentheses,
`` `, `` forced the comma to be interpreted as the multi-statement
operator rather than as a delimiter between parameters. It only worked
this way for commands, not functions or variable declarations.

The escape sequence `` `s `` is now allowed wherever `` `t `` is
supported. It was previously only allowed by #IfWin and (Join.

`*/` can now be placed at the end of a line to end a multi-line comment,
to resolve a common point of confusion relating to how `/* */` works in
other languages. Due to the risk of ambiguity (e.g. with a hotstring
ending in `*/`), any `*/` which is not preceded by `/*` is no longer
ignored (reversing a change made in AHK_L revision 54).

Integer constants and numeric strings outside of the supported range (of
64-bit signed integers) now overflow/wrap around, instead of being
capped at the min/max value. This is consistent with math operators, so
`9223372036854775807+1 == 9223372036854775808` (but both produce
-9223372036854775808). This facilitates bitwise operations on 64-bit
values.

For numeric strings, there are fewer cases where whitespace characters
other than space and tab are allowed to precede the number. The general
rule (in both v1 and v2) is that only space and tab are permitted, but
in some cases other whitespace characters are tolerated due to C runtime
library conventions.

[Else](lib/Else.htm) can now be used with [loops of any
type](Language.htm#loop-statement) and [Catch](lib/Catch.htm). For
loops, it is executed if the loop had zero iterations. For *Catch*, it
is executed if no exception is thrown within *Try* (and is not executed
if any error or value is thrown, even if there is no *Catch* matching
the value\'s class). Consequently, the interpretation of *Else* may
differ from previous versions when used without braces. For example:

    if condition
    {
        while condition
            ; statement to execute for each iteration
    } ; These braces are now required, otherwise else associates with while
    else
        ; statement to execute if condition is false

### Continuation Sections

Smart LTrim: The default behaviour is to count the number of leading
spaces or tabs on the first line below the continuation section options,
and remove that many spaces or tabs from each line thereafter. If the
first line mixes spaces and tabs, only the first type of character is
treated as indentation. If any line is indented less than the first line
or with the wrong characters, all leading whitespace on that line is
left as is.

Quote marks are automatically escaped (i.e. they are interpreted as
literal characters) if the continuation section starts inside a quoted
string. This avoids the need to escape quote marks in multi-line strings
(if the starting and ending quotes are outside the continuation section)
while still allowing multi-line expressions to contain quoted strings.

If the line above the continuation section ends with a name character
and the section does not start inside a quoted string, a single space is
automatically inserted to separate the name from the contents of the
continuation section. This allows a continuation section to be used for
a multi-line expression following `return`, function call statements,
etc. It also ensures variable names are not joined with other tokens (or
names), causing invalid expressions.

Newline characters (`` `n ``) in expressions are treated as spaces. This
allows multi-line expressions to be written using a continuation section
with default options (i.e. omitting `Join`).

The `,` and `%` options have been removed, since there is no longer any
need to escape these characters.

If `(` or `)` appears in the options of a potential continuation section
(other than as part of the `Join` option), the overall line is not
interpreted as the start of a continuation section. In other words,
lines like `(x.y)()` and `(x=y) && z()` are interpreted as expressions.
A multi-line expression can also begin with an open-parenthesis at the
start of a line, provided that there is at least one other `(` or `)` on
the first physical line. For example, the entire expression could be
enclosed with `((` \... `))`.

Excluding the above case, if any invalid options are present, a
load-time error is displayed instead of ignoring the invalid options.

Lines starting with `(` and ending with `:` are no longer excluded from
starting a continuation section on the basis of looking like a label, as
`(` is no longer valid in a label name. This makes it possible for
something like `(Join:` to start a continuation section. However, `(:`
is an error and `(::` is still a hotkey.

A new method of line continuation is supported in expressions and
function/property definitions which utilizes the fact that each
`(`/`[`/`{` must be matched with a corresponding `)`/`]`/`}`. In other
words, if a line contains an unclosed `(`/`[`/`{`, it will be joined
with subsequent lines until the number of opening and closing symbols
balances out. Brace `{` at the end of a line is considered to be
[OTB](lib/Block.htm#otb) (rather than the start of an object literal) if
there are no other unclosed symbols and the brace is not immediately
preceded by an operator.

### Continuation Lines

Line continuation is now more selective about the context in which a
symbol is considered an expression operator. In general, comma and
expression operators can no longer be used for continuation in a textual
context, such as with hotstrings or directives (other than #HotIf), or
after an unclosed quoted string.

Line continuation now works for expression operators at the end of a
line.

`is`, `in` and `contains` are usable for line continuation, though `in`
and `contains` are still reserved/not yet implemented as operators.

`and`, `or`, `is`, `in` and `contains` act as line continuation
operators even if followed by an assignment or other binary operator,
since these are no longer valid variable names. By contrast, v1 had
exceptions for `and`/`or` followed by any of: `<>=/|^:,`

When `.` is used for continuation, the two lines are no longer
automatically delimited by a space if there was no space or tab to the
right of `.` at the start of a line, as in `.VeryLongNestedClassName`.
Note that `x .123`{.no-highlight} is always property access (not
auto-concat) and `x+.123`{.no-highlight} works with or without space.

### Types

In general, v2 produces more consistent results with any code that
depends on the type of a value.

In v1, a variable can contain both a string and a cached binary number,
which is updated whenever the variable is used as a number. Since this
cached binary number is the only means of detecting the type of value,
caching performed internally by expressions like `var+1` or `abs(var)`
effectively changes the \"type\" of `var` as a side-effect. v2 disables
this caching, so that `str := "123"` is always a string and `int := 123`
is always an integer. Consequently, `str` needs to be converted every
time it is used as a number (instead of just the first time), unless it
was originally assigned a pure number.

The built-in \"variables\" `true`, `false`, `A_PtrSize`, `A_Index` and
`A_EventInfo` always return pure integers, not strings. They sometimes
return strings in v1 due to certain optimizations which have been
superseded in v2.

All literal numbers are converted to pure binary numbers at load time
and their string representation is discarded. For example, `MsgBox 0x1`
is equivalent to `MsgBox 1`, while `MsgBox 1.0000` is equivalent to
`MsgBox 1.0` (because the float formatting has changed). Storing a
number in a variable or returning it from a user-defined function
retains its pure numeric status.

The default format specifier for floating-point numbers is now `.17g`
(was `0.6f`{.no-highlight}), which is more compact and more accurate in
many cases. The default cannot be changed, but `Format` can be used to
get different formatting.

Quoted literal strings and strings produced by concatenating with quoted
literal strings are no longer unconditionally considered non-numeric.
Instead, they are treated the same as strings stored in variables or
returned from functions. This has the following implications:

-   Quoted literal `"0"` is considered false.
-   `("0xA") + 1` and `("0x" Chr(65)) + 1` produce 11 instead of
    failing.
-   `x[y:="0"]` and `x["0"]` now behave the same.

The operators `=` and `!=` now compare their operands alphabetically if
both are strings, even if they are numeric strings. Numeric comparison
is still performed when both operands are numeric and at least one
operand is a pure number (not a string). So for example, `54` and
`"530"` are compared numerically, while `"54"` and `"530"` are compared
alphabetically. Additionally, strings stored in variables are treated no
differently from literal strings.

The relational operators `<`, `<=`, `>` and `>=` now throw an exception
if used with a non-numeric string. Previously they compared numerically
or alphabetically depending on whether both inputs were numeric, but
literal quoted strings were always considered non-numeric. Use
`StrCompare(a, b, CaseSense)` instead.

`Type(Value)` returns one of the following strings: String, Integer,
Float, or the specific class of an object.

`Float(Value)`, `Integer(Value)` and `String(Value)` convert *Value* to
the respective type, or throw an exception if the conversion cannot be
performed (e.g. `Integer("1z")`). `Number(Value)` converts to Integer or
Float. `String(Value)` calls `Value.ToString()` if *Value* is an object.
(Ideally this would be done for any implicit conversion from object to
string, but the current implementation makes this difficult.)

## Objects

Objects now use a more structured class-prototype approach, separating
class/static members from instance members. Many of the built-in methods
and Obj functions have been moved, renamed, changed or removed.

-   Each user-defined or built-in class is a class object (an instance
    of [Class](lib/Class.htm)) exposing only methods and properties
    defined with the `static` keyword (including static members
    inherited from the base class) and nested classes.
-   Each class object has a [Prototype](lib/Class.htm#Prototype)
    property which becomes the `base` of all instances of that class.
    All non-static method and property definitions inside the class body
    are attached to the prototype object.
-   Instantiation is performed by calling the static
    [Call](lib/Class.htm#Call) method, as in `myClass.Call()` or
    `myClass()`. This allows the class to fully override construction
    behaviour (e.g. to implement a class factory or singleton, or to
    construct a native Array or Map instead of an Object), although
    initialization should still typically be performed in `__New`. The
    return value of `__New` is now ignored; to override the return
    value, do so from the Call method.

The mixed Object type has been split into `Object`, `Array` and `Map`
(associative array).

Object is now the root class for all user-defined **and built-in**
objects (this excludes VarRef and COM objects). Members added to
`Object.Prototype` are inherited by all AutoHotkey objects.

The operator `is` expects a class, so `x is y` checks for `y.Prototype`
in the base object chain. To check for *y* itself, call `x.HasBase(y)`
or `HasBase(x, y)`.

User-defined classes can also explicitly extend `Object`, `Array`, `Map`
or some other built-in class (though doing so is not always useful),
with `Object` being the default base class if none is specified.

The `new` operator has been removed. Instead, just omit the operator, as
in `MyClass()`. To construct an object *based on* another object that is
not a class, create it with `{}` or `Object()` (or by any other means)
and set its `base`. `__Init` and `__New` can be called explicitly if
needed, but generally this is only appropriate when instantiating a
class.

Nested class definitions now produce a dynamic property with *get* and
*call* accessor functions instead of a simple value property. This is to
support the following behaviour:

-   `Nested.Class()` does not pass *Nested* to `Nested.Class.Call` and
    ultimately `__New`, which would otherwise happen because this is the
    normal behaviour for function objects called as methods (which is
    how the nested class is being used here).
-   `Nested.Class := 1` is an error by default (the property is
    read-only).
-   Referring to or calling the class for the first time causes it to be
    initialized.

GetCapacity and SetCapacity were removed.

-   [ObjGetCapacity](lib/Object.htm#GetCapacity) and
    [ObjSetCapacity](lib/Object.htm#SetCapacity) now only affect the
    object\'s capacity to contain properties, and are not expected to be
    commonly used. Setting the capacity of the string buffer of a
    property, array element or map element is not supported; for binary
    data, use a [Buffer object](lib/Buffer.htm).
-   Array and Map have a Capacity property which corresponds to the
    object\'s current array or map allocation.

Other redundant Obj functions (which mirror built-in methods of Object)
were removed. [ObjHasOwnProp](lib/Object.htm#HasOwnProp) (formerly
ObjHasKey) and [ObjOwnProps](lib/Object.htm#OwnProps) (formerly
ObjNewEnum) are kept to facilitate safe inspection of objects which have
redefined those methods (and the primitive prototypes, which don\'t have
them defined). ObjCount was replaced with
[ObjOwnPropCount](lib/Object.htm#OwnPropCount) (a function only, for all
Objects) and Map has its own [Count](lib/Map.htm#Count) property.

ObjRawGet and ObjRawSet were merged into
[GetOwnPropDesc](lib/Object.htm#GetOwnPropDesc) and
[DefineProp](lib/Object.htm#DefineProp). The original reasons for adding
them were superseded by other changes, such as the `Map` type, changes
to how meta-functions work, and DefineProp itself superseding
meta-functions for some purposes.

Top-level class definitions now create a constant (read-only variable);
that is, assigning to a class name is now an error rather than an
optional warning, except where a local variable shadows the global class
(which now occurs by default when assigning inside a function).

### Primitive Values

Primitive values emulate objects by delegating method and property calls
to a prototype object based on their type, instead of the v1 \"default
base object\". Integer and Float extend Number. String and Number extend
Primitive. Primitive and Object extend Any. These all exist as
predefined classes.

### Properties and Methods

Methods are defined by properties, unlike v2.0-a104 to v2.0-a127, where
they are separate to properties. However, unlike v1, properties created
by a class method definition (or built-in method) are read-only by
default. Methods can still be created by assigning new value properties,
which generally act as in v1.

The Object class defines new methods for dealing with properties and
methods: [DefineProp](lib/Object.htm#DefineProp),
[DeleteProp](lib/Object.htm#DeleteProp),
[GetOwnPropDesc](lib/Object.htm#GetOwnPropDesc),
[HasOwnProp](lib/Object.htm#HasOwnProp),
[OwnProps](lib/Object.htm#OwnProps). Additional methods are defined for
all values (except ComObjects): [GetMethod](lib/Any.htm#GetMethod),
[HasProp](lib/Any.htm#HasProp), [HasMethod](lib/Any.htm#HasMethod).

Object, Array and Map are now separate types, and array elements are
separate from properties.

All built-in methods and properties (including `base`) are defined the
same way as if user-defined. This ensures consistent behaviour and
permits both built-in and user-defined members to be detected, retrieved
or redefined.

If a property does not accept parameters, they are automatically passed
to the object returned by the property (or it throws).

Attempting to retrieve a non-existent property is treated as an error
for all types of values or objects, unless `__get` is defined. However,
setting a non-existent property will create it in most cases.

Multi-dimension array hacks were removed. `x.y[z]:=1` no longer creates
an object in `x.y`, and `x[y,z]` is an error unless x.\_\_item handles
two parameters (or x.\_\_item.\_\_item does, etc.).

If a property defines `get` but not `set`, assigning a value throws
instead of overriding the property.

[DefineProp](lib/Object.htm#DefineProp) can be used to define what
happens when a specific property is retrieved, set *or called*, without
having to define any meta-functions. Property and method definitions in
classes utilize the same mechanism, so it is possible to define a
property getter/setter and a method with the same name.

`{}` object literals now directly set *own property* values or the
object\'s `base`. That is, `__Set` and property setters are no longer
invoked (which would typically only be possible if `base` is set within
the parameter list).

### Static/Class Variables

Static/class variable initializers are now executed within the context
of a `static __Init` method, so `this` refers to the class and the
initializers can create local variables. They are evaluated when the
class is referenced for the first time (rather than being evaluated
before the auto-execute section begins, strictly in the order of
definition). If the class is not referenced sooner, they are evaluated
when the class definition is reached during execution, so initialization
of global variables can occur first, without putting them into a class.

### Meta-Functions

Meta-functions were greatly simplified; they act like normal methods:

-   Where they are defined within the hierarchy is not important.
-   If overridden, the base version is not called automatically. Scripts
    can call `super.__xxx()` if needed.
-   If defined, it must perform the default action; e.g. if \_\_set does
    not store the value, it is not stored.
-   Behaviour is not dependent on whether the method uses `return` (but
    of course, \_\_get and \_\_call still need to return a value).

Method and property parameters are passed as an Array. This optimizes
for chained base/superclass calls and (in combination with MaxParams
validation) encourages authors to handle the args. For \_\_set, the
value being assigned is passed separately.

    this.__call(name, args)
    this.__get(name, args)
    this.__set(name, args, value)

Defined properties and methods take precedence over meta-functions,
regardless of whether they were defined in a base object.

\_\_Call is not called for internal calls to \_\_Enum (formerly
\_NewEnum) or Call, such as when an object is passed to a
[for-loop](lib/For.htm) or a function object is being called by
[SetTimer](lib/SetTimer.htm).

The static method \_\_New is called for each class when it is
initialized, if defined by that class or inherited from a superclass.
See [Static/Class Variables](#staticclass-variables) (above) and [Class
Initialization](Objects.htm#static__New) for more detail.

### Array

`class Array extends Object`

An Array object contains a list or sequence of values, with index 1
being the first element.

When assigning or retrieving an array element, the absolute value of the
index must be between 1 and the [Length](lib/Array.htm#Length) of the
array, otherwise an exception is thrown. An array can be resized by
inserting or removing elements with the appropriate method, or by
assigning [Length](lib/Array.htm#Length).

Currently brackets are required when accessing elements; i.e. `a.1`
refers to a property and `a[1]` refers to an element.

Negative values can be used to index in reverse.

Usage of [Clone](lib/Array.htm#Clone), [Delete](lib/Array.htm#Delete),
[InsertAt](lib/Array.htm#InsertAt), [Pop](lib/Array.htm#Pop),
[Push](lib/Array.htm#Push) and [RemoveAt](lib/Array.htm#RemoveAt) is
basically unchanged. HasKey was renamed to [Has](lib/Array.htm#Has).
[Length](lib/Array.htm#Length) is now a property. The
[Capacity](lib/Array.htm#Capacity) property was added.

Arrays can be constructed with `Array(values*)` or `[values*]`. Variadic
functions receive an Array of parameters, and Arrays are also created by
several built-in functions.

For-loop usage is `for val in arr` or `for idx, val in arr`, where
`idx = A_Index` by default. That is, elements lacking a value are still
enumerated, and the index is not returned if only one variable is
passed.

### Map

A Map object is an associative array with capabilities similar to the v1
Object, but less ambiguity.

-   [Clone](lib/Map.htm#Clone) is used as before.
-   [Delete](lib/Map.htm#Delete) can only delete one key at a time.
-   HasKey was renamed to [Has](lib/Map.htm#Has).
-   [Count](lib/Map.htm#Count) is now a property.
-   New properties: [Capacity](lib/Map.htm#Capacity),
    [CaseSense](lib/Map.htm#CaseSense)
-   New methods: [Get](lib/Map.htm#Get), [Set](lib/Map.htm#Set),
    [Clear](lib/Map.htm#Clear)
-   String keys are case-sensitive by default and are never converted to
    Integer.

Currently Float keys are still converted to strings.

Brackets are required when accessing elements; i.e. `a.b` refers to a
property and `a["b"]` refers to an element. Unlike in v1, a property or
method cannot be accidentally disabled by assigning an array element.

An exception is thrown if one attempts to retrieve the value of an
element which does not exist, unless the map has a
[Default](lib/Map.htm#Default) property defined.
`MapObj.Get(key, default)` can be used to explicitly provide a default
value for each request.

Use `Map(Key, Value, ...)` to create a map from a list of key-value
pairs.

### Enumeration

Changed enumerator model:

-   Replaced \_NewEnum() with \_\_Enum(n).
-   The required parameter n contains the number of variables in the
    for-loop, to allow it to affect enumeration without having to
    postpone initialization until the first iteration call.
-   Replaced Next() with Call(), with the same usage except that ByRef
    works differently now; for instance, a method defined as `Call(&a)`
    should assign `a := next_value` while `Call(a)` would receive a
    [VarRef](Concepts.htm#variable-references), so should assign
    `%a% := next_value`.
-   If \_\_Enum is not present, the object is assumed to be an
    enumerator. This allows function objects (such as
    [closures](Functions.htm#closures)) to be used directly.

Since array elements and properties are now separate, enumerating
properties requires explicitly creating an enumerator by calling
[OwnProps](lib/Object.htm#OwnProps).

### Bound Functions

When a [bound function](misc/Functor.htm#BoundFunc) is called,
parameters passed by the caller fill in any positions that were omitted
when creating the bound function. For example, `F.Bind(,b).Call(a,c)`
calls `F(a,b,c)` rather than `F(,b,a,c)`.

### COM Objects (ComObject)

COM wrapper objects now identify as instances of a few different classes
depending on their variant type (which affects what methods and
properties they support, as before):

-   `ComValue` is the base class for all COM wrapper objects.
-   `ComObject` is for VT_DISPATCH with a non-null pointer; that is,
    typically a valid COM object that can be invoked by the script using
    normal object syntax.
-   `ComObjArray` is for VT_ARRAY (SafeArrays).
-   `ComValueRef` is for VT_BYREF.

These classes can be used for type checks with `obj is ComObject` and
similar. Properties and methods can be defined for objects of type
ComValue, ComObjArray and ComValueRef (but not ComObject) by modifying
the respective prototype object.

`ComObject(CLSID)` creates a ComObject; i.e. this is the new
ComObjCreate.

Note: If you are updating old code and get a TypeError due to passing an
Integer to ComObject, it\'s likely that you should be calling ComValue
instead.

`ComValue(vt, value)` creates a wrapper object. It can return an
instance of any of the classes listed above. This replaces
`ComObjParameter(vt, value)`, `ComObject(vt, value)` and any other names
that were used with a *variant type* and *value* as parameters. *value*
is converted to the appropriate type (following COM conventions),
instead of requiring an integer with the right binary value. In
particular, the following behave differently to before when passed an
integer: R4, R8, Cy, Date. Pointer types permit either a pure integer
address as before, or an object/ComValue.

`ComObjFromPtr(pdsp)` is a function similar to `ComObjEnwrap(dsp)`, but
like ObjFromPtr, it does not call AddRef on the pointer. The equivalent
in v1 is `ComObject(9, dsp, 1)`; omitting the third parameter in v1
caused an AddRef.

For both ComValue and ComObjFromPtr, be warned that AddRef is never
called automatically; in that respect, they behave like
`ComObject(9, value, 1)` or `ComObject(13, value, 1)` in v1. This does
not necessarily mean you should add `ObjAddRef(value)` when updating old
scripts, as many scripts used the old function incorrectly.

COM wrapper objects with variant type VT_BYREF, VT_ARRAY or VT_UNKNOWN
now have a *Ptr* property equivalent to `ComObjValue(ComObj)`. This
allows them to be passed to [DllCall](lib/DllCall.htm) or
[ComCall](lib/ComCall.htm) with the *Ptr* arg type. It also allows the
object to be passed directly to [NumPut](lib/NumPut.htm) or
[NumGet](lib/NumGet.htm), which may be used with VT_BYREF (access the
caller\'s typed variable), VT_ARRAY (access SAFEARRAY fields) or
VT_UNKNOWN (retrieve vtable pointer).

COM wrapper objects with variant type VT_DISPATCH or VT_UNKNOWN and a
null interface pointer now have a *Ptr* property which can be read or
assigned. Once assigned a non-null pointer, the property is read-only.
This is intended for use with [DllCall](lib/DllCall.htm) and
[ComCall](lib/ComCall.htm), so the pointer does not need to be manually
wrapped after the function returns.

Enumeration of ComObjArray is now consistent with Array; i.e.
`for value in arr` or `for index, value in arr` rather than
`for value, vartype in arr`. The starting value for *index* is the lower
bound of the ComObjArray (`arr.MinIndex()`), typically 0.

The integer types I1, I8, UI1, UI2, UI4 and UI8 are now converted to
Integer rather than String. These occur rarely in COM calls, but this
also applies to VT_BYREF wrappers. VT_ERROR is no longer converted to
Integer; it instead produces a ComValue.

COM objects no longer set [A_LastError](Variables.htm#LastError) when a
property or method invocation fails.

### Default Property

A COM object may have a \"default property\", which has two uses:

-   The *value* of the object. For instance, in VBScript, `MsgBox obj`
    evaluates the object by invoking its default member.
-   The indexed property of a collection, which is usually named *Item*
    or *item*.

AutoHotkey v1 had no concept of a default property, so the COM object
wrapper would invoke the default property if the property name was
omitted; i.e. `obj[]` or `obj[,x]`.

However, AutoHotkey v2 separates properties from array/map/collection
items, and to do this `obj[x]` is mapped to the object\'s default
property (whether or not *x* is present). For AutoHotkey objects, this
is `__Item`.

Some COM objects which represent arrays or collections do not expose a
default property, so items cannot be accessed with `[]` in v2. For
instance, JavaScript array objects and some other objects normally used
with JavaScript expose array elements as properties. In such cases,
`arr.%i%` can be used to access an array element-property.

When an AutoHotkey v2 [Array object](lib/Array.htm) is passed to
JavaScript, its elements cannot be retrieved with JavaScript\'s
`arr[i]`, because that would attempt to access a property.

### COM Calls

Calls to AutoHotkey objects via the IDispatch interface now
transparently support VT_BYREF parameters. This would most commonly be
used with COM events ([ComObjConnect](lib/ComObjConnect.htm)).

For each VT_BYREF parameter, an unnamed temporary var is created, the
value is copied from the caller\'s variable, and a
[VarRef](Concepts.htm#variable-references) is passed to the AutoHotkey
function/method. Upon return, the value is copied from the temporary var
back into the caller\'s variable.

A function/method can assign a value by declaring the parameter ByRef
(with `&`) or by explicit dereferencing.

For example, a parameter of type `VT_BYREF|VT_BOOL` would previously
have received a ComObjRef object, and would be assigned a value like
`pbCancel[] := true` or `NumPut(-1, ComObjValue(pbCancel), "short")`.
Now the parameter can be defined as `&bCancel` and assigned like
`bCancel := true`; or can be defined as `pbCancel` and assigned like
`%pbCancel% := true`.

### Modified Commands, Functions & Directives {#lib-modified}

About the section title: there are no commands in v2, just functions.
The title refers to both versions.

[BlockInput](lib/BlockInput.htm) is no longer momentarily disabled
whenever an Alt event is sent with the SendEvent method. This was
originally done to work around a bug in some versions of Windows XP,
where BlockInput blocked the artificial Alt event.

`Chr(0)` returns a string of length 1, containing a binary zero. This is
a result of improved support for binary zero in strings.

[ClipWait](lib/ClipWait.htm) now returns 0 (false) if the wait period
expires, otherwise 1 (true). ErrorLevel was removed. Specifying 0 is no
longer the same as specifying 0.5; instead, it produces the shortest
wait possible.

`ComObj()`: This function had a sort of wildcard name, allowing many
different suffixes. Some names were more commonly used with specific
types of parameters, such as `ComObjActive(CLSID)`,
`ComObjParameter(vt, value)`, `ComObjEnwrap(dsp)`. There are instead now
separate functions/classes, and no more wildcard names. See [COM Objects
(ComObject)](#com-objects-comobject) for details.

Control: Several changes have been made to [the *Control*
parameter](lib/Control.htm#Parameter) used by the [Control
functions](lib/Control.htm), [SendMessage](lib/SendMessage.htm) and
[PostMessage](lib/PostMessage.htm):

-   It can now accept a HWND (must be a pure integer) or an object with
    a *Hwnd* property, such as a [GuiControl
    object](lib/GuiControl.htm). The HWND can identify a control or a
    top-level window, though the latter is usually only meaningful for a
    select few functions (see below).
-   It is no longer optional, except with functions which can operate on
    a top-level window ([ControlSend\[Text\]](lib/ControlSend.htm),
    [ControlClick](lib/ControlClick.htm),
    [SendMessage](lib/SendMessage.htm),
    [PostMessage](lib/PostMessage.htm)) or when preceded by other
    optional parameters
    ([ListViewGetContent](lib/ListViewGetContent.htm),
    [ControlGetPos](lib/ControlGetPos.htm),
    [ControlMove](lib/ControlMove.htm)).
-   If omitted, the target window is used instead. This matches the
    previous behaviour of
    [SendMessage](lib/SendMessage.htm)/[PostMessage](lib/PostMessage.htm),
    and replaces the `ahk_parent` special value previously used by
    [ControlSend](lib/ControlSend.htm).
-   Blank values are invalid. Functions never default to the target
    window\'s topmost control.

[ControlGetFocus](lib/ControlGetFocus.htm) now returns the control\'s
HWND instead of its ClassNN, and no longer considers there to be an
error when it has successfully determined that the window has no focused
control.

[ControlMove](lib/ControlMove.htm),
[ControlGetPos](lib/ControlGetPos.htm) and
[ControlClick](lib/ControlClick.htm) now use client coordinates (like
[GuiControl](lib/GuiControl.htm)) instead of window coordinates. Client
coordinates are relative to the top-left of the client area, which
excludes the window\'s title bar and borders. (Controls are rendered
only inside the client area.)

[ControlMove](lib/ControlMove.htm), [ControlSend](lib/ControlSend.htm)
and [ControlSetText](lib/ControlSetText.htm) now use parameter order
consistent with the other Control functions; i.e. ***Control**,
WinTitle, WinText, ExcludeTitle, ExcludeText* are always grouped
together (at the end of the parameter list), to aide memorisation.

[CoordMode](lib/CoordMode.htm) no longer accepts \"Relative\" as a mode,
since all modes are relative to something. It was synonymous with
\"Window\", so use that instead.

[DllCall](lib/DllCall.htm): See [DllCall](#dllcall) section further
below.

[Edit](lib/Edit.htm) previously had fallback behaviour for the `.ini`
file type if the \"edit\" shell verb was not registered. This was
removed as script files are not expected to have the `.ini` extension.
`AutoHotkey.ini` was the default script name in old versions of
AutoHotkey.

[Edit](lib/Edit.htm) now does nothing if the script was read from stdin,
instead of attempting to open an editor for `*`.

[EnvSet](lib/EnvSet.htm) now deletes the environment variable if the
*Value* parameter is completely omitted.

[Exit](lib/Exit.htm) previously acted as [ExitApp](lib/ExitApp.htm) when
the script is not persistent, even if there were other suspended threads
interrupted by the thread which called Exit. It no longer does this.
Instead, it always exits the current thread properly, and (if
non-persistent) the script terminates only after the last thread exits.
This ensures [Finally](lib/Finally.htm) statements are executed and
local variables are freed, which may allow `__delete` to be called for
any objects contained by local variables.

[FileAppend](lib/FileAppend.htm) defaults to no end-of-line
translations, consistent with [FileRead](lib/FileRead.htm) and
[FileOpen](lib/FileOpen.htm). FileAppend and FileRead both have a
separate *Options* parameter which replaces the option prefixes and may
include an optional encoding name (superseding FileRead\'s `*Pnnn`
option). FileAppend, FileRead and FileOpen use `` "`n" `` to enable
end-of-line translations. FileAppend and FileRead support an option
`"RAW"` to disable codepage conversion (read/write binary data);
FileRead returns a [Buffer object](lib/Buffer.htm) in this case. This
replaces `*c` (see [ClipboardAll](lib/ClipboardAll.htm)). FileAppend may
accept a Buffer-like object, in which case no conversions are performed.

[FileCopy](lib/FileCopy.htm) and [FileMove](lib/FileMove.htm) now throw
an exception if the source path does not contain `*` or `?` and no file
was not found. However, it is still not considered an error to copy or
move zero files when the source path contains wildcards.

[FileOpen](lib/FileOpen.htm) now throws an exception if it fails to open
the file. Otherwise, an exception would be thrown (if the script didn\'t
check for failure) by the first attempt to access the object, rather
than at the actual point of failure.

[File.RawRead](lib/File.htm#RawRead): When a variable is passed
directly, the address of the variable\'s internal string buffer is no
longer used. Therefore, a variable containing an address may be passed
directly (whereas in v1, something like `var+0` was necessary).

For buffers allocated by the script, the new [Buffer
object](lib/Buffer.htm) is preferred over a variable; any object can be
used, but must have *Ptr* and *Size* properties.

[File.RawWrite](lib/File.htm#RawWrite): As above, except that it can
accept a string (or variable containing a string), in which case *Bytes*
defaults to the size of the string in bytes. The string may contain
binary zero.

[File.ReadLine](lib/File.htm#ReadLine) now always supports `` `r ``,
`` `n `` and `` `r`n `` as line endings, and no longer includes the line
ending in the return value. Line endings are still returned to the
script as-is by [File.Read](lib/File.htm#Read) if EOL translation is not
enabled.

[FileEncoding](lib/FileEncoding.htm) now allows code pages to be
specified by number without the `CP` prefix. Its parameter is no longer
optional, but can still be explicitly blank.

[FileExist](lib/FileExist.htm) now ignores the `.` and `..` implied in
every directory listing, so `FileExist("dir\*")` is now false instead of
true when dir exists but is empty.

[FileGetAttrib](lib/FileGetAttrib.htm) and A_LoopFileAttrib now include
the letter \"L\" for reparse points or symbolic links.

[FileInstall](lib/FileInstall.htm) in a non-compiled script no longer
attempts to copy the file if source and destination are the same path
(after resolving relative paths, as the source is relative to
[A_ScriptDir](Variables.htm#ScriptDir), not
[A_WorkingDir](Variables.htm#WorkingDir)). In v1 this caused ErrorLevel
to be set to 1, which mostly went unnoticed. Attempting to copy a file
onto itself via two different paths still causes an error.

FileSelectFile (now named [FileSelect](lib/FileSelect.htm)) had two
multi-select modes, accessible via options 4 and M. Option 4 and the
corresponding mode have been removed; they had been undocumented for
some time. FileSelect now returns an Array of paths when the
multi-select mode is used, instead of a string like
`` C:\Dir`nFile1`nFile2 ``. Each array element contains the full path of
a file. If the user cancels, the array is empty.

FileSelect now uses the IFileDialog API present in Windows Vista and
later, instead of the old GetOpenFileName/GetSaveFileName API. This
removes the need for (built-in) workarounds relating to the dialog
changing the current working directory.

FileSelect no longer has a redundant \"Text Documents (\*.txt)\" filter
by default when *Filter* is omitted.

FileSelect no longer strips spaces from the filter pattern, such as for
`pattern with spaces*.ext`. Testing indicates spaces on either side of
the pattern (such as after the semi-colon in `*.cpp; *.h`) are already
ignored by the OS, so there should be no negative consequences.

FileSelect can now be used in \"Select Folder\" mode via the `D` option
letter.

[FileSetAttrib](lib/FileSetAttrib.htm) now overwrites attributes when no
+, - or \^ prefix is present, instead of doing nothing. For example,
`FileSetAttrib(FileGetAttrib(file2), file1)` copies the attributes of
file2 to file1 (adding any that file2 has and removing any that it does
not have).

[FileSetAttrib](lib/FileSetAttrib.htm) and
[FileSetTime](lib/FileSetTime.htm): the *OperateOnFolders* and *Recurse*
parameters have been replaced with a single *Mode* parameter identical
to that of [Loop Files](lib/LoopFiles.htm). For example,
`FileSetAttrib("+a", "*.zip", "RF")` (Recursively operate on Files
only).

[GetKeyName](lib/GetKeyName.htm) now returns the non-Numpad names for VK
codes that correspond to both a Numpad and a non-Numpad key. For
instance, `GetKeyName("vk25")` returns Left instead of NumpadLeft.

[GetKeyState](lib/GetKeyState.htm) now always returns 1 or 0 instead of
On or Off.

[GroupActivate](lib/GroupActivate.htm) now returns the HWND of the
window which was selected for activation, or 0 if there were no matches
(aside from the already-active window), instead of setting ErrorLevel.

[GroupAdd](lib/GroupAdd.htm): Removed the *Label* parameter and related
functionality. This was an unintuitive way to detect when GroupActivate
fails to find any matching windows; GroupActivate\'s return value should
be used instead.

[GroupDeactivate](lib/GroupDeactivate.htm) now selects windows in a
manner closer to the [Alt]{.kbd}+[Esc]{.kbd} and
[Alt]{.kbd}+[Shift]{.kbd}+[Esc]{.kbd} system hotkeys and the taskbar.
Specifically,

-   Owned windows are not evaluated. If the owner window is eligible
    (not a match for the group), either the owner window or one of its
    owned windows is activated; whichever was active last. A window
    owned by a group member will no longer be activated, but adding the
    owned window itself to the group now has no effect. (The previous
    behaviour was to cycle through every owned window and never activate
    the owner.)
-   Any disabled window is skipped, unless one of its owned windows was
    active more recently than it.
-   Windows with the WS_EX_NOACTIVATE style are skipped, since they are
    probably not supposed to be activated. They are also skipped by the
    [Alt]{.kbd}+[Esc]{.kbd} and [Alt]{.kbd}+[Shift]{.kbd}+[Esc]{.kbd}
    system hotkeys.
-   Windows with WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW but not WS_EX_APPWINDOW are omitted
    from the taskbar and Alt-Tab, and are therefore skipped.

[Hotkey](lib/Hotkey.htm) no longer defaults to the script\'s bottommost
[#HotIf](lib/_HotIf.htm) (formerly #If). Hotkey/hotstring and HotIf
threads default to the same criterion as the hotkey, so
`Hotkey A_ThisHotkey, "Off"` turns off the current hotkey even if it is
context-sensitive. All other threads default to the last setting used by
the auto-execute section, which itself defaults to no criterion (global
hotkeys).

[Hotkey](lib/Hotkey.htm)\'s *Action* parameter now requires a function
object or hotkey name. Labels and function names are no longer
supported. If a hotkey name is specified, the original function of that
hotkey is used; and unlike before, this works with
[#HotIf](lib/_HotIf.htm) (formerly #If).

-   Among other benefits, this eliminates ambiguity with the following
    special strings: `On`, `Off`, `Toggle`, `AltTab`, `ShiftAltTab`,
    `AltTabAndMenu`, `AltTabMenuDismiss`. The old behaviour was to use
    the label/function by that name if one existed, but only if the
    *Label* parameter did not contain a variable reference or
    expression.

[Hotkey](lib/Hotkey.htm) and [Hotstring](lib/Hotstring.htm) now support
the S option to make the hotkey/hostring exempt from
[Suspend](lib/Suspend.htm) (equivalent to the new
[#SuspendExempt](lib/_SuspendExempt.htm) directive), and the S0 option
to disable exemption.

\"Hotkey If\" and the other If sub-commands were replaced with
individual functions: [HotIf, HotIfWinActive, HotIfWinExist,
HotIfWinNotActive, HotIfWinNotExist](lib/HotIf.htm).

[HotIf](lib/HotIf.htm) (formerly \"Hotkey If\") now recognizes
expressions which use the `and` or `or` operators. This did not work in
v1 as these operators were replaced with `&&` or `||` at load time.

[Hotkey](lib/Hotkey.htm) no longer has a UseErrorLevel option, and never
sets ErrorLevel. An exception is thrown on failure. Error messages were
changed to be constant (and shorter), with the key or hotkey name in
`Exception.Extra`, and the class of the exception indicating the reason
for failure.

[#HotIf](lib/_HotIf.htm) (formerly #If) now implicitly creates a
function with one parameter (ThisHotkey). As is the default for all
functions, this function is [assume-local](Functions.htm#AssumeLocal).
The expression can create local variables and read global variables, but
cannot directly assign to global variables as the expression cannot
contain declarations.

#HotIf has been optimized so that simple calls to
[WinActive](lib/WinActive.htm) or [WinExist](lib/WinExist.htm) can be
evaluated directly by the hook thread (as #IfWin was in v1, and
[HotIfWin](lib/HotIf.htm) still is). This improves performance and
reduces the risk of problems when the script is busy/unresponsive. This
optimization applies to expressions which contain a single call to
[WinActive](lib/WinActive.htm) or [WinExist](lib/WinExist.htm) with up
to two parameters, where each parameter is a simple quoted string and
the result is optionally inverted with `!` or `not`. For example,
`#HotIf WinActive("Chrome")` or `#HotIf !WinExist("Popup")`. In these
cases, the first expression with any given combination of criteria can
be identified by either the expression or the window criteria. For
example, `HotIf '!WinExist("Popup")'` and `HotIfWinNotExist "Popup"`
refer to the same hotkey variants.

`KeyHistory N` resizes the key history buffer instead of displaying the
key history. This replaces \"#KeyHistory N\".

[ImageSearch](lib/ImageSearch.htm) returns 1 (true) if the image was
found, 0 (false) if it was not found, or throws an exception if the
search could not be conducted. ErrorLevel is not set.

[IniDelete](lib/IniDelete.htm), [IniRead](lib/IniRead.htm) and
[IniWrite](lib/IniWrite.htm) set [A_LastError](Variables.htm#LastError)
to the result of the operating system\'s GetLastError() function.

[IniRead](lib/IniRead.htm) throws an exception if the requested key,
section or file cannot be found and the *Default* parameter was omitted.
If *Default* is given a value, even `""`, no exception is thrown.

[InputHook](lib/InputHook.htm) now treats
[Shift]{.kbd}+[Backspace]{.kbd} the same as [Backspace]{.kbd}, instead
of transcribing it to `` `b ``.

[InputBox](lib/InputBox.htm) has been given a syntax overhaul to make it
easier to use (with fewer parameters). See [InputBox](#inputbox) for
usage.

[InStr](lib/InStr.htm)\'s *CaseSensitive* parameter has been replaced
with *CaseSense*, which can be 0, 1 or \"Locale\".

InStr now searches right-to-left when *Occurrence* is negative (which
previously caused a result of 0), and no longer searches right-to-left
if a negative *StartingPos* is used with a positive *Occurrence*.
(However, it still searches right-to-left if *StartingPos* is negative
and *Occurrence* is omitted.) This facilitates right-to-left searches in
a loop, and allows a negative *StartingPos* to be used while still
searching left-to-right.

-   For example, `InStr(a, b,, -1, 2)` now searches left-to-right. To
    instead search right-to-left, use `InStr(a, b,, -1, -2)`.
-   Note that a *StartingPos* of -1 means the last character in v2, but
    the second last character in v1. If the example above came from v1
    (rather than v2.0-a033 - v2.0-a136), the new code should be
    `InStr(a, b, -2, -2)`.

[KeyWait](lib/KeyWait.htm) now returns 0 (false) if the wait period
expires, otherwise 1 (true). ErrorLevel was removed.

[MouseClick](lib/MouseClick.htm) and
[MouseClickDrag](lib/MouseClickDrag.htm) are no longer affected by the
system setting for swapped mouse buttons; \"Left\" is the always the
primary button and \"Right\" is the secondary.

[MsgBox](lib/MsgBox.htm) has had its syntax changed to prioritise its
most commonly used parameters and improve ease of use. See
[MsgBox](#msgbox) further below for a summary of usage.

[NumPut](lib/NumPut.htm)/[NumGet](lib/NumGet.htm): When a variable is
passed directly, the address of the variable\'s internal string buffer
is no longer used. Therefore, a variable containing an address may be
passed directly (whereas in v1, something like `var+0` was necessary).
For buffers allocated by the script, the new [Buffer
object](lib/Buffer.htm) is preferred over a variable; any object can be
used, but must have *Ptr* and *Size* properties.

NumPut\'s parameters were reordered to allow a sequence of values, with
the (now mandatory) type string preceding each number. For example:
`NumPut("ptr", a, "int", b, "int", c, addrOrBuffer, offset)`. Type is
now mandatory for NumGet as well. (In comparison to
[DllCall](lib/DllCall.htm), NumPut\'s input parameters correspond to the
dll function\'s parameters, while NumGet\'s return type parameter
corresponds to the dll function\'s return type string.)

The use of `Object(obj)` and `Object(ptr)` to convert between a
reference and a pointer was shifted to separate functions,
`ObjPtrAddRef(obj)` and `ObjFromPtrAddRef(ptr)`. There are also versions
of these functions that do not increment the reference count:
`ObjPtr(obj)` and `ObjFromPtr(ptr)`.

The OnClipboardChange label is no longer called automatically if it
exists. Use the [OnClipboardChange](lib/OnClipboardChange.htm) function
which was added in v1.1.20 instead. It now requires a function object,
not a name.

[OnError](lib/OnError.htm) now requires a function object, not a name.
See also [Error Handling](#error-handling) further below.

The OnExit command has been removed; use the [OnExit](lib/OnExit.htm)
function which was added in v1.1.20 instead. It now requires a function
object, not a name. A_ExitReason has also been removed; its value is
available as a parameter of the OnExit callback function.

[OnMessage](lib/OnMessage.htm) no longer has the
single-function-per-message mode that was used when a function name
(string) was passed; it now only accepts a function by reference. Use
`OnMessage(x, MyFunc)` where *MyFunc* is literally the name of a
function, but note that the v1 equivalent would be
`OnMessage(x, Func("MyFunc"))`, which allows other functions to continue
monitoring message x, unlike `OnMessage(x, "MyFunc")`. To stop
monitoring the message, use `OnMessage(x, MyFunc, 0)` as
`OnMessage(x, "")` and `OnMessage(x)` are now errors. On failure,
OnMessage throws an exception.

[Pause](lib/Pause.htm) is no longer exempt from
[#MaxThreadsPerHotkey](lib/_MaxThreadsPerHotkey.htm) when used on the
first line of a hotkey, so `#p::Pause` is no longer suitable for
toggling pause. Therefore, `Pause()` now only pauses the current thread
(for combinations like ListVars/Pause), while `Pause(Value)` now always
operates on the underlying thread. *Value* must be 0, 1 or -1. The
second parameter was removed.

[PixelSearch](lib/PixelSearch.htm) and
[PixelGetColor](lib/PixelGetColor.htm) use RGB values instead of BGR,
for consistency with other functions. Both functions throw an exception
if a problem occurs, and no longer set ErrorLevel. PixelSearch returns 1
(true) if the color was found. PixelSearch\'s slow mode was removed, as
it is unusable on most modern systems due to an incompatibility with
desktop composition.

[PostMessage](lib/PostMessage.htm): See [SendMessage](#SendMessage)
further below.

[Random](lib/Random.htm) has been reworked to utilize the operating
system\'s random number generator, lift several restrictions, and make
it more convenient to use.

-   The full 64-bit range of signed integer values is now supported
    (increased from 32-bit).
-   Floating-point numbers are generated from a 53-bit random integer,
    instead of a 32-bit random integer, and should be greater than or
    equal to *Min* and lesser than *Max* (but floating-point rounding
    errors can theoretically produce equal to *Max*).
-   The parameters could already be specified in any order, but now
    specifying only the first parameter defaults the other bound to 0
    instead of 2147483647. For example, `Random(9)` returns a number
    between 0 and 9.
-   If both parameters are omitted, the return value is a floating-point
    number between 0.0 (inclusive) and 1.0 (generally exclusive),
    instead of an integer between 0 and 2147483647 (inclusive).
-   The system automatically seeds the random number generator, and does
    not provide a way to manually seed it, so there is no replacement
    for the *NewSeed* parameter.

[RegExMatch](lib/RegExMatch.htm) options O and P were removed; O
(object) mode is now mandatory. The RegExMatch object now supports
enumeration (for-loop). The match object\'s syntax has changed:

-   \_\_Get is used to implement the shorthand `match.subpat` where
    *subpat* is the name of a subpattern/capturing group. As \_\_Get is
    no longer called if a property is *inherited*, the following
    subpattern names can no longer be used with the shorthand syntax:
    Pos, Len, Name, Count, Mark. (For example, `match.Len` always
    returns the length of the overall match, not a captured string.)
-   Originally the match object had methods instead of properties so
    that properties could be reserved for subpattern names. As new
    language behaviour implies that `match.name` would return a function
    by default, the methods have been replaced or supplemented with
    properties:
    -   Pos, Len and Name are now properties and methods.
    -   Name now requires one parameter to avoid confusion (`match.Name`
        throws an error).
    -   Count and Mark are now only properties.
    -   Value has been removed; use `match.0` or `match[]` instead of
        `match.Value()`, and `match[N]` instead of `match.Value(N)`.

RegisterCallback was renamed to [CallbackCreate](lib/CallbackCreate.htm)
and changed to better utilize [closures](Functions.htm#closures):

-   It now supports [function objects](misc/Functor.htm) (and no longer
    supports function names).
-   Removed *EventInfo* parameter (use a
    [closure](Functions.htm#closures) or [bound
    function](misc/Functor.htm#BoundFunc) instead).
-   Removed the special behaviour of variadic callback functions and
    added the `&` option (pass the address of the parameter list).
-   Added `CallbackFree(Address)`, to free the callback memory and
    release the associated function object.

Registry functions ([RegRead](lib/RegRead.htm),
[RegWrite](lib/RegWrite.htm), [RegDelete](lib/RegDelete.htm)): the new
syntax added in v1.1.21+ is now the only syntax. Root key and subkey are
combined. Instead of `RootKey, SubKey`, write `RootKey\SubKey`. To
connect to a remote registry, use `\\ComputerName\RootKey\SubKey`
instead of `\\ComputerName:RootKey, SubKey`.

RegWrite\'s parameters were reordered to put *Value* first, like
IniWrite (but this doesn\'t affect the single-parameter mode, where
*Value* was the only parameter).

When *KeyName* is omitted and the current loop reg item is a subkey,
RegDelete, RegRead and RegWrite now operate on values within that
subkey; i.e. *KeyName* defaults to `A_LoopRegKey "\" A_LoopRegName` in
that case (note that A_LoopRegKey was merged with A_LoopRegSubKey).
Previously they behaved as follows:

-   RegRead read a value with the same name as the subkey, if one
    existed in the parent key.
-   RegWrite returned an error.
-   RegDelete deleted the subkey.

RegDelete, RegRead and RegWrite now allow *ValueName* to be specified
when *KeyName* is omitted:

-   If the current loop reg item is a subkey, *ValueName* defaults to
    empty (the subkey\'s default value) and *ValueType* must be
    specified.
-   If the current loop reg item is a value, *ValueName* and *ValueType*
    default to that value\'s name and type, but one or both can be
    overridden.

Otherwise, RegDelete with a blank or omitted *ValueName* now deletes the
key\'s default value (not the key itself), for consistency with
RegWrite, RegRead and A_LoopRegName. The phrase \"AHK_DEFAULT\" no
longer has any special meaning. To delete a key, use
[RegDeleteKey](lib/RegDeleteKey.htm) (new).

[RegRead](lib/RegRead.htm) now has a *Default* parameter, like IniRead.

RegRead had an undocumented 5-parameter mode, where the value type was
specified after the output variable. This has been removed.

[Reload](lib/Reload.htm) now does nothing if the script was read from
stdin.

[Run](lib/Run.htm) and [RunWait](lib/Run.htm) no longer recognize the
UseErrorLevel option as ErrorLevel was removed. Use
[Try](lib/Try.htm)/[Catch](lib/Catch.htm) instead.
[A_LastError](Variables.htm#LastError) is set unconditionally, and can
be inspected after an exception is caught/suppressed. RunWait returns
the exit code.

[Send](lib/Send.htm) (and its variants) now interpret `{LButton}` and
`{RButton}` in a way consistent with hotkeys and [Click](lib/Click.htm).
That is, LButton is the primary button and RButton is the secondary
button, even if the user has swapped the buttons via system settings.

[SendMessage](lib/SendMessage.htm) and
[PostMessage](lib/PostMessage.htm) now require wParam and lParam to be
integers or objects with a Ptr property; an exception is thrown if they
are given a non-numeric string or float. Previously a string was passed
by address if the expression began with `"`, but other strings were
coerced to integers. Passing the address of a variable (formerly `&var`,
now `StrPtr(var)`) no longer updates the variable\'s length (use
`VarSetStrCapacity(&var, -1)`).

SendMessage and PostMessage now throw an exception on failure (or
timeout) and do not set ErrorLevel. SendMessage returns the message
reply.

[SetTimer](lib/SetTimer.htm) no longer supports label or function names,
but as it now accepts an expression and functions can be referenced
directly by name, usage looks very similar: `SetTimer MyFunc`. As with
all other functions which accept an object, SetTimer now allows
expressions which return an object (previously it required a variable
reference).

[Sort](lib/Sort.htm) has received the following changes:

-   The *VarName* parameter has been split into separate input/output
    parameters, for flexibility. Usage is now
    `Output := Sort(Input [, Options, Callback])`.
-   When any two items compare equal, the original order of the items is
    now automatically used as a tie-breaker to ensure more stable
    results.
-   The `C` option now also accepts a suffix equivalent to the
    *CaseSense* parameter of other functions (in addition to `CL`):
    `CLocale CLogical COn C1 COff C0`. In particular, support for the
    \"logical\" comparison mode is new.

[Sound functions](lib/Sound.htm): SoundGet and SoundSet have been
revised to better match the capabilities of the Vista+ sound APIs,
dropping support for XP.

-   Removed unsupported control types.
-   Removed legacy mixer component types.
-   Let components be referenced by name and/or index.
-   Let devices be referenced by name-prefix and/or index.
-   Split into separate Volume and Mute functions.
-   Added [SoundGetName](lib/SoundGetName.htm) for retrieving device or
    component names.
-   Added [SoundGetInterface](lib/SoundGetInterface.htm) for retrieving
    COM interfaces.

[StrGet](lib/StrGet.htm): If *Length* is negative, its absolute value
indicates the exact number of characters to convert, including any
binary zeros that the string might contain - in other words, the result
is always a string of exactly that length. If *Length* is positive, the
converted string ends at the first binary zero as in v1.

[StrGet](lib/StrGet.htm)/[StrPut](lib/StrPut.htm): The *Address*
parameter can be an object with the *Ptr* and *Size* properties, such as
the new [Buffer object](lib/Buffer.htm). The read/write is automatically
limited by *Size* (which is in bytes). If *Length* is also specified, it
must not exceed *Size* (multiplied by 2 for UTF-16).

StrPut\'s return value is now in bytes, so it can be passed directly to
`Buffer()`.

[StrReplace](lib/StrReplace.htm) now has a *CaseSense* parameter in
place of *OutputVarCount*, which is moved one parameter to the right,
with *Limit* following it.

[Suspend](lib/Suspend.htm): Making a hotkey or hotstring\'s first line a
call to Suspend no longer automatically makes it exempt from suspension.
Instead, use `#SuspendExempt` or the `S` option. The \"Permit\"
parameter value is no longer valid.

[Switch](lib/Switch.htm) now performs case-sensitive comparison for
strings by default, and has a *CaseSense* parameter which overrides the
mode of case sensitivity and forces string (rather than numeric)
comparison. Previously it was case-sensitive only if StringCaseSense was
changed to On.

[SysGet](lib/SysGet.htm) now only has numeric sub-commands; its other
sub-commands have been split into functions. See
[Sub-Commands](#sub-commands) further below for details.

[TrayTip](lib/TrayTip.htm)\'s usage has changed to
`TrayTip [Text, Title, Options]`. *Options* is a string of zero or more
case-insensitive options delimited by a space or tab. The options are
`Iconx`, `Icon!`, `Iconi`, `Mute` and/or any numeric value as before.
TrayTip now shows even if *Text* is omitted (which is now harder to do
by accident than in v1). The *Timeout* parameter no long exists (it had
no effect on Windows Vista or later). Scripts may now use the NIIF_USER
(0x4) and NIIF_LARGE_ICON (0x20) flags in combination (0x24) to include
the large version of the tray icon in the notification. NIIF_USER (0x4)
can also be used on its own for the small icon, but may not have
consistent results across all OSes.

#Warn UseUnsetLocal and UseUnsetGlobal have been removed, as reading an
unset variable now raises an error. [IsSet](lib/IsSet.htm) can be used
to avoid the error and [Try](lib/Try.htm)/[Catch](lib/Catch.htm) or
[OnError](lib/OnError.htm) can be used to handle it.

[#Warn VarUnset](lib/_Warn.htm#VarUnset) was added; it defaults to
MsgBox. If not disabled, a warning is given for the first non-dynamic
reference to each variable which is never used as the target of a
direct, non-dynamic assignment or the reference operator (&), or passed
directly to IsSet.

[#Warn Unreachable](lib/_Warn.htm#Unreachable) no longer considers lines
following an [Exit](lib/Exit.htm) call to be unreachable, as Exit is now
an ordinary function.

#Warn ClassOverwrite has been removed, as top-level classes can no
longer be overwritten by assignment. (However, they can now be
implicitly shadowed by a local variable; that can be detected by #Warn
LocalSameAsGlobal.)

[WinActivate](lib/WinActivate.htm) now sends `{Alt up}` after its first
failed attempt at activating a window. Testing has shown this reduces
the occurrence of flashing taskbar buttons. See the documentation for
more details.

[WinClose](lib/WinClose.htm) and [WinKill](lib/WinKill.htm): For
*SecondsToWait*, specifying 0 is no longer the same as specifying 0.5;
instead, it produces the shortest wait possible.

[WinSetTitle](lib/WinSetTitle.htm) and [WinMove](lib/WinMove.htm) now
use parameter order consistent with other Win functions; i.e. *WinTitle,
WinText, ExcludeTitle, ExcludeText* are always grouped together (at the
end of the parameter list), to aide memorisation.

The *WinTitle* parameter of various functions can now accept a HWND
(must be a pure integer) or an object with a *Hwnd* property, such as a
[Gui object](lib/Gui.htm).
[DetectHiddenWindows](lib/DetectHiddenWindows.htm) is ignored in such
cases, except when used with [WinWait](lib/WinWait.htm) or
[WinWaitClose](lib/WinWaitClose.htm).

[WinMove](lib/WinMove.htm) no longer has special handling for the
literal word `DEFAULT`{.no-highlight}. Omit the parameter or specify an
empty string instead (this works in both v1 and v2).

[WinWait](lib/WinWait.htm), [WinWaitClose](lib/WinWaitClose.htm),
[WinWaitActive](lib/WinWaitActive.htm) and
[WinWaitNotActive](lib/WinWaitActive.htm) return non-zero if the wait
finished (timeout did not expire). ErrorLevel was removed. WinWait and
WinWaitActive return the HWND of the found window. WinWaitClose now sets
the [Last Found Window](misc/WinTitle.htm#LastFoundWindow), so if
WinWaitClose times out, it returns 0 (false) and `WinExist()` returns
the last window it found. For *Timeout*, specifying 0 is no longer the
same as specifying 0.5; instead, it produces the shortest wait possible.

**Unsorted:**

A negative *StartingPos* for [InStr](lib/InStr.htm),
[SubStr](lib/SubStr.htm), [RegExMatch](lib/RegExMatch.htm) and
[RegExReplace](lib/RegExReplace.htm) is interpreted as a position from
the end. Position -1 is the last character and position 0 is invalid
(whereas in v1, position 0 was the last character).

Functions which previously accepted On/Off or On/Off/Toggle (but not
other strings) now require 1/0/-1 instead. On and Off would typically be
replaced with `True` and `False`. Variables which returned On/Off now
return 1/0, which are more useful in expressions.

-   [#UseHook](lib/_UseHook.htm) and
    [#MaxThreadsBuffer](lib/_MaxThreadsBuffer.htm) allow `1`, `0`,
    `True` and `False`. (Unlike the others, they do not actually support
    expressions.)
-   [ListLines](lib/ListLines.htm) allows omitted or boolean.
-   [ControlSetChecked](lib/ControlSetChecked.htm),
    [ControlSetEnabled](lib/ControlSetEnabled.htm),
    [Pause](lib/Pause.htm), [Suspend](lib/Suspend.htm),
    [WinSetAlwaysOnTop](lib/WinSetAlwaysOnTop.htm), and
    [WinSetEnabled](lib/WinSetEnabled.htm) allow `1`, `0` and `-1`.
-   [A_DetectHiddenWindows](Variables.htm#DetectHiddenWindows),
    [A_DetectHiddenText](Variables.htm#DetectHiddenText), and
    [A_StoreCapsLockMode](Variables.htm#StoreCapsLockMode) use boolean
    (as do the corresponding functions).

The following functions return a pure integer instead of a hexadecimal
string:

-   [ControlGetExStyle](lib/ControlGetStyle.htm)
-   [ControlGetHwnd](lib/ControlGetHwnd.htm)
-   [ControlGetStyle](lib/ControlGetStyle.htm)
-   [MouseGetPos](lib/MouseGetPos.htm)
-   [WinActive](lib/WinActive.htm)
-   [WinExist](lib/WinExist.htm)
-   [WinGetID](lib/WinGetID.htm)
-   [WinGetIDLast](lib/WinGetIDLast.htm)
-   [WinGetList](lib/WinGetList.htm) (within the Array)
-   [WinGetStyle](lib/WinGetStyle.htm)
-   [WinGetStyleEx](lib/WinGetStyle.htm)
-   [WinGetControlsHwnd](lib/WinGetControlsHwnd.htm) (within the Array)

[A_ScriptHwnd](Variables.htm#ScriptHwnd) also returns a pure integer.

#### DllCall

If a type parameter is a variable, that variable\'s content is always
used, never its name. In other words, unquoted type names are no longer
supported - type names must be enclosed in quote marks.

When DllCall updates the length of a variable passed as Str or WStr, it
now detects if the string was not properly null-terminated (likely
indicating that buffer overrun has occurred), and terminates the program
with an error message if so, as safe execution cannot be guaranteed.

`AStr` (without any suffix) is now input-only. Since the buffer is only
ever as large as the input string, it was usually not useful for output
parameters. This would apply to WStr instead of AStr if AutoHotkey is
compiled for ANSI, but official v2 releases are only ever compiled for
Unicode.

If a function writes a new address to a `Str*`, `AStr*` or `WStr*`
parameter, DllCall now assigns the new string to the corresponding
variable if one was supplied, instead of merely updating the length of
the original string (which probably hasn\'t changed). Parameters of this
type are usually not used to modify the input string, but rather to pass
back a string at a new address.

DllCall now accepts an object for any `Ptr` parameter and the *Function*
parameter; the object must have a *Ptr* property. For buffers allocated
by the script, the new [Buffer object](lib/Buffer.htm) is preferred over
a variable. For `Ptr*`, the parameter\'s new value is assigned back to
the object\'s *Ptr* property. This allows constructs such as
`DllCall(..., "Ptr*", unk := IUnknown())`, which reduces repetition
compared to `DllCall(..., "Ptr*", punk), unk := IUnknown(punk)`, and can
be used to ensure any output from the function is properly freed (even
if an exception is thrown due to the `HRESULT` return type, although
typically the function would not output a non-null pointer in that
case).

DllCall now requires the values of numeric-type parameters to be
numeric, and will throw an exception if given a non-numeric or empty
string. In particular, if the \* or P suffix is used for output
parameters, the output variable is required to be initialized.

The output value (if any) of numeric parameters with the \* or P suffix
is ignored if the script passes a plain variable containing a number. To
receive the output value, pass a
[VarRef](Concepts.htm#variable-references) such as `&myVar` or an object
with a *Ptr* property.

The new `HRESULT` return type throws an exception if the function failed
(`int < 0` or `uint & 0x80000000`). This should be used only with
functions that actually return a `HRESULT`.

#### Loop Sub-commands

The sub-command keyword must be written literally; it must not be
enclosed in quote marks and cannot be a variable or expression. All
other parameters are expressions. All loop sub-commands now support
[OTB](lib/Block.htm#otb).

Removed:

``` no-highlight
Loop, FilePattern [, IncludeFolders, Recurse]
Loop, RootKey [, Key, IncludeSubkeys, Recurse]
```

Use the following (added in v1.1.21) instead:

    Loop Files, FilePattern [, Mode]
    Loop Reg, KeyName [, Mode]

The comma after the second word is now optional.

[A_LoopRegKey](lib/LoopReg.htm#vars) now contains the root key and
subkey, and A_LoopRegSubKey was removed.

#### InputBox

    InputBoxObj := InputBox([Prompt, Title, Options, Default])

The *Options* parameter accepts a string of zero or more
case-insensitive options delimited by a space or tab, similar to Gui
control options. For example, this includes all supported options:
`"x0 y0 w100 h100 T10.0 Password*"`. `T` is timeout and `Password` has
the same usage as the equivalent Edit control option.

The width and height options now set the size of the client area (the
area excluding the title bar and window frame), so are less
theme-dependent.

The title will be blank if the *Title* parameter is an empty string. It
defaults to [A_ScriptName](Variables.htm#ScriptName) only when
completely omitted, consistent with optional parameters of user-defined
functions.

*InputBoxObj* is an object with the properties *Result* (containing
\"OK\", \"Cancel\" or \"Timeout\") and *Value*.

#### MsgBox

    Result := MsgBox([Text, Title, Options])

The *Options* parameter accepts a string of zero or more
case-insensitive options delimited by a space or tab, similar to Gui
control options.

-   `Iconx`, `Icon?`, `Icon!` and `Iconi` set the icon.
-   `Default`{.no-highlight} followed immediately by an integer sets the
    *n*th button as default.
-   `T` followed immediately by an integer or floating-point number sets
    the timeout, in seconds.
-   `Owner` followed immediately by a HWND sets the owner, overriding
    the Gui `+OwnDialogs` option.
-   One of the following mutually-exclusive strings sets the button
    choices: `OK`, `OKCancel`, `AbortRetryIgnore`, `YesNoCancel`,
    `YesNo`, `RetryCancel`, `CancelTryAgainContinue`, or just the
    initials separated by slashes (`o/c`, `y/n`, etc.), or just the
    initials without slashes.
-   Any numeric value, the same as in v1. Numeric values can be combined
    with string options, or *Options* can be a pure integer.

The return value is the English name of the button, without spaces.
These are the same strings that were used with IfMsgBox in v1.

The title will be blank if the *Title* parameter is an empty string. It
defaults to [A_ScriptName](Variables.htm#ScriptName) only when
completely omitted, consistent with optional parameters of user-defined
functions.

#### Sub-Commands

Sub-commands of Control, ControlGet, Drive, DriveGet, WinGet, WinSet and
Process have been replaced with individual functions, and the main
commands have been removed. Names and usage have been changed for
several of the functions. The new usage is shown below:

    ; Where ... means optional Control, WinTitle, etc.

    Bool  := ControlGetChecked(...)
    Bool  := ControlGetEnabled(...)
    Bool  := ControlGetVisible(...)
    Int   := ControlGetIndex(...)  ; For Tab, LB, CB, DDL
    Str   := ControlGetChoice(...)
    Arr   := ControlGetItems(...)
    Int   := ControlGetStyle(...)
    Int   := ControlGetExStyle(...)
    Int   := ControlGetHwnd(...)

             ControlSetChecked(TrueFalseToggle, ...)
             ControlSetEnabled(TrueFalseToggle, ...)
             ControlShow(...)
             ControlHide(...)
             ControlSetStyle(Value, ...)
             ControlSetExStyle(Value, ...)
             ControlShowDropDown(...)
             ControlHideDropDown(...)
             ControlChooseIndex(Index, ...)  ; Also covers Tab
    Index := ControlChooseString(Str, ...)

    Index := ControlFindItem(Str, ...)
    Index := ControlAddItem(Str, ...)
             ControlDeleteItem(Index, ...)

    Int   := EditGetLineCount(...)
    Int   := EditGetCurrentLine(...)
    Int   := EditGetCurrentCol(...)
    Str   := EditGetLine(N [, ...])
    Str   := EditGetSelectedText(...)
             EditPaste(Str, ...)

    Str   := ListViewGetContent([Options, ...])

             DriveEject([Drive])
             DriveRetract([Drive])
             DriveLock(Drive)
             DriveUnlock(Drive)
             DriveSetLabel(Drive [, Label])

    Str   := DriveGetList([Type])
    Str   := DriveGetFilesystem(Drive)
    Str   := DriveGetLabel(Drive)
    Str   := DriveGetSerial(Drive)
    Str   := DriveGetType(Path)
    Str   := DriveGetStatus(Path)
    Str   := DriveGetStatusCD(Drive)
    Int   := DriveGetCapacity(Path)
    Int   := DriveGetSpaceFree(Path)

    ; Where ... means optional WinTitle, etc.

    Int   := WinGetID(...)
    Int   := WinGetIDLast(...)
    Int   := WinGetPID(...)
    Str   := WinGetProcessName(...)
    Str   := WinGetProcessPath(...)
    Int   := WinGetCount(...)
    Arr   := WinGetList(...)
    Int   := WinGetMinMax(...)
    Arr   := WinGetControls(...)
    Arr   := WinGetControlsHwnd(...)
    Int   := WinGetTransparent(...)
    Str   := WinGetTransColor(...)
    Int   := WinGetStyle(...)
    Int   := WinGetExStyle(...)

             WinSetTransparent(N [, ...])
             WinSetTransColor("Color [N]" [, ...]),
             WinSetAlwaysOnTop([TrueFalseToggle := 1, ...])
             WinSetStyle(Value [, ...])
             WinSetExStyle(Value [, ...])
             WinSetEnabled(Value [, ...])
             WinSetRegion(Value [, ...])

             WinRedraw(...)
             WinMoveBottom(...)
             WinMoveTop(...)

    PID   := ProcessExist([PID_or_Name])
    PID   := ProcessClose(PID_or_Name)
    PID   := ProcessWait(PID_or_Name [, Timeout])
    PID   := ProcessWaitClose(PID_or_Name [, Timeout])

             ProcessSetPriority(Priority [, PID_or_Name])

[ProcessExist](lib/ProcessExist.htm),
[ProcessClose](lib/ProcessClose.htm), [ProcessWait](lib/ProcessWait.htm)
and [ProcessWaitClose](lib/ProcessWaitClose.htm) no longer set
ErrorLevel; instead, they return the PID.

None of the other functions set ErrorLevel. Instead, they throw an
exception on failure. In most cases failure is because the target window
or control was not found.

HWNDs and styles are always returned as pure integers, not hexadecimal
strings.

[ControlChooseIndex](lib/ControlChooseIndex.htm) allows 0 to deselect
the current item/all items. It replaces \"Control Choose\", but also
supports Tab controls.

\"ControlGet Tab\" was merged into
[ControlGetIndex](lib/ControlGetIndex.htm), which also works with
ListBox, ComboBox and DDL. For Tab controls, it returns 0 if no tab is
selected (rare but valid).
[ControlChooseIndex](lib/ControlChooseIndex.htm) does not permit 0 for
Tab controls since applications tend not to handle it.

[ControlGetItems](lib/ControlGetItems.htm) replaces \"ControlGet List\"
for ListBox and ComboBox. It returns an Array.

[DriveEject](lib/DriveEject.htm) and [DriveRetract](lib/DriveEject.htm)
now use DeviceIoControl instead of mciSendString. DriveEject is
therefore able to eject non-CD/DVD drives which have an \"Eject\" option
in Explorer (i.e. removable drives but not external hard drives which
show as fixed disks).

[ListViewGetContent](lib/ListViewGetContent.htm) replaces \"ControlGet
List\" for ListView, and currently has the same usage as before.

[WinGetList](lib/WinGetList.htm),
[WinGetControls](lib/WinGetControls.htm) and
[WinGetControlsHwnd](lib/WinGetControlsHwnd.htm) return arrays, not
newline-delimited lists.

[WinSetTransparent](lib/WinSetTransparent.htm) treats `""` as `"Off"`
rather than `0` (which would make the window invisible and unclickable).

Abbreviated aliases such as Topmost, Trans, FS and Cap were removed.

The following functions were formerly sub-commands of
[SysGet](lib/SysGet.htm):

    ActualN := MonitorGet([N, &Left, &Top, &Right, &Bottom])
    ActualN := MonitorGetWorkArea([N, &Left, &Top, &Right, &Bottom])
    Count   := MonitorGetCount()
    Primary := MonitorGetPrimary()
    Name    := MonitorGetName([N])

### New Functions

`Buffer([ByteCount, FillByte])` (calling the Buffer class) creates and
returns a `Buffer` object encapsulating a block of memory with a size of
*ByteCount* bytes, initialized only if *FillByte* is specified.
`BufferObj.Ptr` returns the address and `BufferObj.Size` returns or sets
the size in bytes (reallocating the block of memory). Any object with
*Ptr* and *Size* properties can be passed to [NumPut](lib/NumPut.htm),
[NumGet](lib/NumGet.htm), [StrPut](lib/StrPut.htm),
[StrGet](lib/StrGet.htm), [File.RawRead](lib/File.htm#RawRead),
[File.RawWrite](lib/File.htm#RawWrite) and
[FileAppend](lib/FileAppend.htm). Any object with a *Ptr* property can
be passed to [DllCall](lib/DllCall.htm) parameters with `Ptr` type,
[SendMessage](lib/SendMessage.htm) and
[PostMessage](lib/PostMessage.htm).

`CaretGetPos([&OutputVarX, &OutputVarY])` retrieves the current
coordinates of the caret (text insertion point). This ensures the X and
Y coordinates always match up, and there is no caching to cause
unexpected behaviour (such as A_CaretX/Y returning a value that\'s not
in the current CoordMode).

`ClipboardAll([Data, Size])` creates an object containing everything on
the clipboard (optionally accepting data previously retrieved from the
clipboard instead of using the clipboard\'s current contents). The
methods of reading and writing clipboard file data are different. The
data format is the same, except that the data size is always 32-bit, so
that the data is portable between 32-bit and 64-bit builds. See the v2
documentation for details.

`ComCall(offset, comobj, ...)` is equivalent to
`DllCall(NumGet(NumGet(comobj.ptr) + offset * A_Index), "ptr", comobj.ptr, ...)`,
but with the return type defaulting to `HRESULT` rather than `Int`.

[ComObject](lib/ComObject.htm) (formerly ComObjCreate) and
[ComObjQuery](lib/ComObjQuery.htm) now return a wrapper object even if
an IID is specified. ComObjQuery permits the first parameter to be any
object with a *Ptr* property.

[ControlGetClassNN](lib/ControlGetClassNN.htm) returns the ClassNN of
the specified control.

[ControlSendText](lib/ControlSend.htm), equivalent to ControlSendRaw but
using Text mode instead of Raw mode.

`DirExist(FilePattern)`, with usage similar to FileExist. Note that a
wildcard check like `InStr(FileExist("MyFolder\*"), "D")` with
*MyFolder* containing files and subfolders will only tell you whether
the [first]{.underline} matching file is a folder, not whether a folder
exists.

`Float(Value)`: See [Types](#types) further above.

`InstallKeybdHook([Install, Force])` and
`InstallMouseHook([Install, Force])` replace the corresponding
directives, for increased flexibility.

`Integer(Value)`: See [Types](#types) further above.

[IsXXX](lib/Is.htm): The legacy command \"if Var is Type\" has been
replaced with a series of functions: IsAlnum, IsAlpha, IsDigit, IsFloat,
IsInteger, IsLower, IsNumber, IsSpace, IsUpper, IsXDigit. With the
exception of IsFloat, IsInteger and IsNumber, an exception is thrown if
the parameter is not a string, as implicit conversion to string may
cause counter-intuitive results.

`IsSet(Var)`, `IsSetRef(&Ref)`: Returns 1 (true) if the variable has
been assigned a value (even if that value is an empty string), otherwise
0 (false). If 0 (false), attempting to read the variable within an
expression would throw an error.

`Menu()`/`MenuBar()` returns a new Menu/MenuBar object, which has the
following members corresponding to v1 Menu sub-commands. Methods:
[Add](lib/Menu.htm#Add), [**Add**Standard](lib/Menu.htm#AddStandard),
[Check](lib/Menu.htm#Check), [Delete](lib/Menu.htm#Delete),
[Disable](lib/Menu.htm#Disable), [Enable](lib/Menu.htm#Enable),
[Insert](lib/Menu.htm#Insert), [Rename](lib/Menu.htm#Rename),
[**Set**Color](lib/Menu.htm#SetColor),
[**Set**Icon](lib/Menu.htm#SetIcon), [Show](lib/Menu.htm#Show),
[ToggleCheck](lib/Menu.htm#ToggleCheck),
[ToggleEnable](lib/Menu.htm#ToggleEnable),
[Uncheck](lib/Menu.htm#Uncheck). Properties:
[Click**Count**](lib/Menu.htm#ClickCount),
[Default](lib/Menu.htm#Default), [Handle](lib/Menu.htm#Handle) (replaces
MenuGetHandle). [A_TrayMenu](Variables.htm#TrayMenu) also returns a Menu
object. There is no UseErrorLevel mode, no global menu names, and no
explicitly deleting the menu itself (that happens when all references
are released; the [Delete](lib/Menu.htm#Delete) method is equivalent to
v1 DeleteAll). Labels are not supported, only function objects. The
[AddStandard](lib/Menu.htm#AddStandard) method adds the standard menu
items and allows them to be individually modified as with custom items.
Unlike v1, the Win32 menu is destroyed only when the object is deleted.

`MenuFromHandle(Handle)` retrieves the Menu or MenuBar object
corresponding to a Win32 menu handle, if it was created by AutoHotkey.

`Number(Value)`: See [Types](#types) further above.

`Persistent([Persist])` replaces the corresponding directive, increasing
flexibility.

`RegDeleteKey([KeyName])` deletes a registry key. (RegDelete now only
deletes values, except when omitting all parameters in a registry loop.)

[SendText](lib/Send.htm#SendText), equivalent to SendRaw but using Text
mode instead of Raw mode.

`StrCompare(String1, String2 [, CaseSense])` returns -1 (String1 is less
than String2), 0 (equal) or 1 (greater than). *CaseSense* can be
\"Locale\".

`String(Value)`: See [Types](#types) further above.

`StrPtr(Value)` returns the address of a string. Unlike address-of in
v1, it can be used with literal strings and temporary strings.

`SysGetIPAddresses()` returns an array of IP addresses, equivalent to
the A_IPAddress variables which have been removed. Each reference to
`A_IPAddress%N%` retrieved all addresses but returned only one, so
retrieving multiple addresses took exponentially longer than necessary.
The returned array can have zero or more elements.

`TraySetIcon([FileName, IconNumber, Freeze])` replaces \"Menu Tray,
Icon\".

`VarSetStrCapacity(&TargetVar [, RequestedCapacity])` replaces the v1
VarSetCapacity, but is intended for use only with UTF-16 strings (such
as to optimize repeated concatenation); therefore *RequestedCapacity*
and the return value are in characters, not bytes.

`VerCompare(A, B)` compares two version strings using the same algorithm
as [#Requires](lib/_Requires.htm).

`WinGetClientPos([&OutX, &OutY, &OutWidth, &OutHeight, WinTitle, ...])`
retrieves the position and size of the window\'s client area, in screen
coordinates.

### New Directives

`#DllLoad [FileOrDirName]`: Loads a DLL or EXE file before the script
starts executing.

### Built-in Variables

[A_AhkPath](Variables.htm#AhkPath) always returns the path of the
current executable/interpreter, even when the script is compiled.
Previously it returned the path of the compiled script if a BIN file was
used as the base file, but v2.0 releases no longer include BIN files.

[A_IsCompiled](Variables.htm#IsCompiled) returns 0 instead of \"\" if
the script has not been compiled.

[A_OSVersion](Variables.htm#OSVersion) always returns a string in the
format `major.minor.build`, such as `6.1.7601` for Windows 7 SP1.
A_OSType has been removed as only NT-based systems are supported.

[A_TimeSincePriorHotkey](Variables.htm#TimeSincePriorHotkey) returns
\"\" instead of -1 whenever [A_PriorHotkey](Variables.htm#PriorHotkey)
is \"\", and likewise for
[A_TimeSinceThisHotkey](Variables.htm#TimeSinceThisHotkey) when
[A_ThisHotkey](Variables.htm#ThisHotkey) is blank.

All built-in \"virtual\" variables now have the `A_` prefix (specifics
below). Any predefined variables which lack this prefix (such as
`Object`) are just global variables. The distinction may be important
since it is currently impossible to take a reference to a virtual
variable (except when passed directly to a built-in function); however,
[A_Args](Variables.htm#Args) is not a virtual variable.

Built-in variables which return numbers now return them as an
[integer](Concepts.htm#numbers) rather than a
[string](Concepts.htm#strings).

Renamed:

-   A_LoopFileFullPath →
    [A_LoopFilePath](lib/LoopFiles.htm#LoopFilePath) (returns a relative
    path if the Loop\'s parameter was relative, so \"full path\" was
    misleading)
-   A_LoopFileLongPath →
    [A_LoopFileFullPath](lib/LoopFiles.htm#LoopFileFullPath)
-   Clipboard → [A_Clipboard](lib/A_Clipboard.htm)

Removed:

-   ClipboardAll (replaced with the [ClipboardAll](lib/ClipboardAll.htm)
    function)
-   ComSpec (use [A_ComSpec](Variables.htm#ComSpec))
-   ProgramFiles (use [A_ProgramFiles](Variables.htm#ProgramFiles))
-   A_AutoTrim
-   A_BatchLines
-   A_CaretX, A_CaretY (use [CaretGetPos](lib/CaretGetPos.htm))
-   A_DefaultGui, A_DefaultListView, A_DefaultTreeView
-   A_ExitReason
-   A_FormatFloat
-   A_FormatInteger
-   A_Gui, A_GuiControl, A_GuiControlEvent, A_GuiEvent, A_GuiX, A_GuiY,
    A_GuiWidth, A_GuiHeight (all replaced with parameters of [event
    handlers](lib/GuiOnEvent.htm))
-   A_IPAddress1, A_IPAddress2, A_IPAddress3, A_IPAddress4 (use
    [SysGetIPAddresses](lib/SysGetIPAddresses.htm))
-   A_IsUnicode (v2 is always Unicode; it can be replaced with
    `StrLen(Chr(0xFFFF))` or redefined with `global A_IsUnicode := 1`)
-   A_StringCaseSense
-   A_ThisLabel
-   A_ThisMenu, A_ThisMenuItem, A_ThisMenuItemPos (use the [menu item
    callback\'s parameters](lib/Menu.htm#Add))
-   A_LoopRegSubKey ([A_LoopRegKey](lib/LoopReg.htm#vars) now contains
    the root key and subkey)
-   True and False (still exist, but are now only keywords, not
    variables)

Added:

-   [A_AllowMainWindow](Variables.htm#AllowMainWindow) (read/write;
    replaces \"Menu Tray, MainWindow/NoMainWindow\")
-   [A_HotkeyInterval](Variables.htm#HotkeyInterval) (replaces
    #HotkeyInterval)
-   [A_HotkeyModifierTimeout](Variables.htm#HotkeyModifierTimeout)
    (replaces #HotkeyModifierTimeout)
-   [A_InitialWorkingDir](Variables.htm#InitialWorkingDir) (see [Default
    Settings](#default-settings) further below)
-   [A_MaxHotkeysPerInterval](Variables.htm#MaxHotkeysPerInterval)
    (replaces #MaxHotkeysPerInterval)
-   [A_MenuMaskKey](Variables.htm#MenuMaskKey) (replaces #MenuMaskKey)

The following built-in variables can be assigned values:

-   [A_ControlDelay](Variables.htm#ControlDelay)
-   [A_CoordMode..](Variables.htm#CoordMode)
-   [A_DefaultMouseSpeed](Variables.htm#DefaultMouseSpeed)
-   [A_DetectHiddenText](Variables.htm#DetectHiddenText) (also, it now
    returns 1 or 0 instead of \"On\" or \"Off\")
-   [A_DetectHiddenWindows](Variables.htm#DetectHiddenWindows) (also, it
    now returns 1 or 0 instead of \"On\" or \"Off\")
-   [A_EventInfo](Variables.htm#EventInfo)
-   [A_FileEncoding](Variables.htm#FileEncoding) (also, it now returns
    \"CP0\" in place of \"\", and allows the \"CP\" prefix to be omitted
    when assigning)
-   [A_IconHidden](Variables.htm#IconHidden)
-   [A_IconTip](Variables.htm#IconTip) (also, it now always reflects the
    tooltip, even if it is default or empty)
-   [A_Index](Variables.htm#Index): For counted loops, modifying this
    affects how many iterations are performed. (The global nature of
    built-in variables means that an Enumerator function could set the
    index to be seen by a For loop.)

-   [A_TitleMatchModeSpeed](Variables.htm#TitleMatchModeSpeed)
-   [A_WinDelay](Variables.htm#WinDelay)
-   [A_WorkingDir](Variables.htm#WorkingDir): Same as calling
    [SetWorkingDir](lib/SetWorkingDir.htm).

### Built-in Objects

[File objects](lib/File.htm) now strictly require property syntax when
invoking properties and method syntax when invoking methods. For
example, `FileObj.Pos(n)` is not valid. An exception is thrown if there
are too few or too many parameters, or if a read-only property is
assigned a value.

File.Tell() was removed.

[Func.IsByRef()](lib/Func.htm#IsByRef) now works with built-in
functions.

## Gui

Gui, GuiControl and GuiControlGet were replaced with
[Gui()](lib/Gui.htm#Call) and
[Gui](lib/Gui.htm)/[GuiControl](lib/GuiControl.htm) objects, which are
generally more flexible, more consistent, and easier to use.

A GUI is typically not referenced by name/number (although it can still
be named with `GuiObj.Name`). Instead, a GUI object (and window) is
created explicitly by instantiating the `Gui` class, as in
`GuiObj := Gui()`. This object has methods and properties which replace
the Gui sub-commands. [Gui.Add()](lib/Gui.htm#Add) returns a GuiControl
object, which has methods and properties which replace the GuiControl
and GuiControlGet commands. One can store this object in a variable, or
use `GuiObj["Name"]` or [GuiCtrlFromHwnd](lib/GuiCtrlFromHwnd.htm) to
retrieve the object. It is also passed as a parameter whenever an event
handler (the replacement of a g-label) is called.

The usage of these methods and properties is not 1:1. Many parts have
been revised to be more consistent and flexible, and to fix bugs or
limitations.

There are no \"default\" GUIs, as the target Gui or control object is
always specified. LV/TV/SB functions were replaced with methods (of the
control object), making it much easier to use multiple
ListViews/TreeViews.

There are no built-in variables containing information about events. The
information is passed as parameters to the function/method which handles
the event, including the source Gui or control.

Controls can still be named and be referenced by name, but it\'s just a
name (used with `GuiObj["Name"]` and
[Gui.Submit()](lib/Gui.htm#Submit)), not an associated variable, so
there is no need to declare or create a global or static variable. The
value is never stored in a variable automatically, but is accessible via
[GuiControl.Value](lib/GuiControl.htm#Value).
[Gui.Submit()](lib/Gui.htm#Submit) returns a new associative array using
the control names as keys.

The `v`*`Name`* option now just sets the control\'s name to *Name*.

The `+Hwnd`*`VarName`* option has been removed in favour of
[GuiControl.Hwnd](lib/GuiControl.htm#Hwnd).

There are no more \"g-labels\" or labels/functions which automatically
handle GUI events. The script must register for each event of interest
by calling the [OnEvent](lib/GuiOnEvent.htm) method of the Gui or
GuiControl. For example, rather than checking
`if (A_GuiEvent = "I" && InStr(ErrorLevel, "F", true))` in a g-label,
the script would register a handler for the
[ItemFocus](lib/GuiOnEvent.htm#ItemFocus) event:
`MyLV.OnEvent("ItemFocus", MyFunction)`. *MyFunction* would be called
only for the ItemFocus event. It is not necessary to apply the
`AltSubmit` option to enable additional events.

Arrays are used wherever a pipe-delimited list was previously used, such
as to specify the items for a ListBox when creating it, when adding
items, or when retrieving the selected items.

Scripts can define a class which extends `Gui` and handles its own
events, keeping all of the GUI logic self-contained.

### Gui sub-commands

**Gui New** → [Gui()](lib/Gui.htm#Call). Passing an empty title (not
omitting it) now results in an empty title, not the default title.

**Gui Add** → [Gui.Add() or Gui.Add*ControlType*()](lib/Gui.htm#Add);
e.g. `GuiObj.Add("Edit")` or `GuiObj.AddEdit()`.

**Gui Show** → [Gui.Show()](lib/Gui.htm#Show), but it has no *Title*
parameter. The title can be specified as a parameter of Gui() or via the
Gui.Title property. The initial focus is still set to the first
input-capable control with the WS_TABSTOP style (as per default message
processing by the system), unless that\'s a Button control, in which
case focus is now shifted to the Default button.

**Gui Submit** → [Gui.Submit()](lib/Gui.htm#Submit). It works like
before, except that Submit() creates and returns a new object which
contains all of the \"associated variables\".

**Gui Destroy** → [Gui.Destroy()](lib/Gui.htm#Destroy). The object still
exists (until the script releases it) but cannot be used. A new GUI must
be created (if needed). The window is also destroyed when the object is
deleted, but the object is \"kept alive\" while the window is visible.

**Gui Font** → [Gui.SetFont()](lib/Gui.htm#SetFont). It is also possible
to set a control\'s font directly, with GuiControl.SetFont().

**Gui Color** → [Gui.BackColor](lib/Gui.htm#BackColor) sets/returns the
background color. *ControlColor* (the second parameter) is not
supported, but all controls which previously supported it can have a
background set by the `+Background` option instead. Unlike \"Gui
Color\", Gui.BackColor does not affect Progress controls or
disabled/read-only Edit, DDL, ComboBox or TreeView (with `-Theme`)
controls.

**Gui Margin** → [Gui.MarginX](lib/Gui.htm#MarginX) and
[Gui.MarginY](lib/Gui.htm#MarginY) properties.

**Gui Menu** → [Gui.MenuBar](lib/Gui.htm#MenuBar) sets/returns a MenuBar
object created with `MenuBar()`.

**Gui Cancel/Hide/Minimize/Maximize/Restore** → Gui methods of the same
name.

**Gui Flash** → [Gui.Flash()](lib/Gui.htm#Flash), but use `false`
instead of `Off`.

**Gui Tab** → [GuiControl.UseTab()](lib/GuiControls.htm#Tab_UseTab).
Defaults to matching a prefix of the tab name as before. Pass true for
the second parameter to match the whole tab name, but unlike the v1
\"Exact\" mode, it is case-insensitive.

### Events

See [Events (OnEvent)](lib/GuiOnEvent.htm#Events) for details of all
explicitly supported GUI and GUI control events.

The Size event passes 0, -1 or 1 (consistent with
[WinGetMinMax](lib/WinGetMinMax.htm)) instead of 0, 1 or 2.

The ContextMenu event can be registered for each control, or for the
whole GUI.

The DropFiles event swaps the *FileArray* and *Ctrl* parameters, to be
consistent with ContextMenu.

The ContextMenu and DropFiles events use client coordinates instead of
window coordinates (Client is also the default
[CoordMode](lib/CoordMode.htm) in v2).

The following control events were removed, but detecting them is a
simple case of passing the appropriate numeric notification code
(defined in the Windows SDK) to
[GuiControl.OnNotify()](lib/GuiOnNotify.htm): K, D, d, A, S, s, M, C, E
and MonthCal\'s 1 and 2.

Control events do not pass the event name as a parameter (GUI events
never did).

Custom\'s N and Normal events were replaced with
[GuiControl.OnNotify()](lib/GuiOnNotify.htm) and
[GuiControl.OnCommand()](lib/GuiOnCommand.htm), which can be used with
any control.

Link\'s Click event passes \"Ctrl, ID or Index, HREF\" instead of
\"Ctrl, Index, HREF or ID\", and does not automatically execute HREF if
a Click callback is registered.

ListView\'s Click, DoubleClick and ContextMenu (when triggered by a
right-click) events now report the item which was clicked (or 0 if none)
instead of the focused item.

ListView\'s I event was split into multiple named events, except for the
f (de-focus) event, which was excluded because it is implied by F
(ItemFocus).

ListView\'s e (ItemEdit) event is ignored if the user cancels.

Slider\'s Change event is raised more consistently than the v1 g-label;
i.e. it no longer ignores changes made by the mouse wheel by default.
See [Detecting Changes (Slider)](lib/GuiControls.htm#slider-change) for
details.

The BS_NOTIFY style is now added automatically as needed for Button,
CheckBox and Radio controls. It is no longer applied by default to Radio
controls.

Focus (formerly F) and LoseFocus (formerly f) are supported by more (but
not all) control types.

Setting an Edit control\'s text with Edit.Value or Edit.Text does not
trigger the control\'s Change event, whereas GuiControl would trigger
the control\'s g-label.

LV/TV.Add/Modify now suppress item-change events, so such events should
only be raised by user action or SendMessage.

### Removed

+Delimiter\
+Hwnd*OutputVar* (use [Gui.Hwnd](lib/Gui.htm#Hwnd) or
[GuiControl.Hwnd](lib/GuiControl.htm#Hwnd) instead)\
+Label\
+LastFoundExist\
Gui GuiName: Default

### Control Options

+/-Background is interpreted and supported more consistently. All
controls which supported \"Gui Color\" now support
`+Background`*`Color`* and `+BackgroundDefault` (synonymous with
`-Background`), not just ListView/TreeView/StatusBar/Progress.

[Gui.Add()](lib/Gui.htm#Add) defaults to `y+m`/`x+m` instead of
`yp`/`xp` when `xp`/`yp` or `xp+0`/`yp+0` is used. In other words, the
control is placed below/to the right of the previous control instead of
at exactly the same position. If a non-zero offset is used, the
behaviour is the same as in v1. To use exactly the same position,
specify `xp yp` together.

`x+m` and `y+m` can be followed by an additional offset, such as
`x+m+10` (`x+m10` is also valid, but less readable).

`Choose` no longer serves as a redundant (undocumented) way to specify
the value for a MonthCal. Just use the *Text* parameter, as before.

### GuiControlGet

#### Empty sub-command

GuiControlGet\'s empty sub-command had two modes: the default mode, and
text mode, where the fourth parameter was the word `Text`. If a control
type had no single \"value\", GuiControlGet defaulted to returning the
result of
[GetWindowText](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-getwindowtexta)
(which isn\'t always visible text). Some controls had no visible text,
or did not support retrieving it, so completely ignored the fourth
parameter. By contrast, [GuiControl.Text](lib/GuiControl.htm#Text)
returns display text, hidden text (the same text returned by
ControlGetText) or nothing at all.

The table below shows the closest equivalent property or function for
each mode of GuiControlGet and control type.

  Control     Default   Text               Notes
  ----------- --------- ------------------ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ActiveX     .Value    .Text              Text is hidden. See below.
  Button      .Text                        
  CheckBox    .Value    .Text              
  ComboBox    .Text     ControlGetText()   Use Value instead of Text if AltSubmit was used (but Value returns 0 if Text does not match a list item). Text performs case-correction, whereas ControlGetText returns the Edit field\'s content.
  Custom      .Text                        
  DateTime    .Value                       
  DDL         .Text                        Use Value instead of Text if AltSubmit was used.
  Edit        .Value                       
  GroupBox    .Text

  Link        .Text                        
  ListBox     .Text     ControlGetText()   Use Value instead of Text if AltSubmit was used. Text returns the selected item\'s text, whereas ControlGetText returns hidden text. See below.
  ListView    .Text                        Text is hidden.
  MonthCal    .Value                       
  Picture     .Value                       
  Progress    .Value                       
  Radio       .Value    .Text              
  Slider      .Value                       
  StatusBar   .Text                        
  Tab         .Text     ControlGetText()   Use Value instead of Text if AltSubmit was used. Text returns the selected tab\'s text, whereas ControlGetText returns hidden text.
  Text        .Text                        
  TreeView    .Text                        Text is hidden.
  UpDown      .Value                       

ListBox: For multi-select ListBox, Text and Value return an array
instead of a pipe-delimited list.

ActiveX: [GuiControl.Value](lib/GuiControl.htm#Value) returns the same
object each time, whereas GuiControlGet created a new wrapper object
each time. Consequently, it is no longer necessary to retain a reference
to an ActiveX object for the purpose of keeping a
[ComObjConnect](lib/ComObjConnect.htm) connection alive.

#### Other sub-commands

**Pos** → [GuiControl.GetPos()](lib/GuiControl.htm#GetPos)

**Focus** → [Gui.FocusedCtrl](lib/Gui.htm#FocusedCtrl); returns a
GuiControl object instead of the ClassNN.

**FocusV** → `GuiObj.FocusedCtrl.Name`

**Hwnd** → [GuiControl.Hwnd](lib/GuiControl.htm#Hwnd); returns a pure
integer, not a hexadecimal string.

**Enabled/Visible/Name** → GuiCtrl properties of the same name.

### GuiControl

#### (Blank) and Text sub-commands

The table below shows the closest equivalent property or method for each
mode of GuiControl and control type.

  Control     (Blank)                 Text           Notes
  ----------- ----------------------- -------------- --------------------------------------------------
  ActiveX     N/A                                    Command had no effect.
  Button      .Text                                  
  CheckBox    .Value                  .Text          
  ComboBox    .Delete/Add/Choose      .Text          
  Custom      .Text                                  
  DateTime    .Value                  .SetFormat()   
  DDL         .Delete/Add/Choose                     
  Edit        .Value

  Link        .Text                                  
  ListBox     .Delete/Add/Choose                     
  ListView    N/A                                    Command had no effect.
  MonthCal    .Value

  Progress    .Value                                 Use the `+=` operator instead of the `+` prefix.
  Radio       .Value                  .Text          
  Slider      .Value                                 Use the `+=` operator instead of the `+` prefix.
  StatusBar   .Text or SB.SetText()                  
  Tab         .Delete/Add/Choose

  TreeView    N/A                                    Command had no effect.
  UpDown      .Value                                 Use the `+=` operator instead of the `+` prefix.

#### Other sub-commands

**Move** → [GuiControl.Move()](lib/GuiControl.htm#Move)

**MoveDraw** → GuiControl.Move(),
[GuiControl.Redraw()](lib/GuiControl.htm#Redraw)

**Focus** → [GuiControl.Focus()](lib/GuiControl.htm), which now uses
WM_NEXTDLGCTL instead of SetFocus, so that focusing a Button temporarily
sets it as the default, consistent with tabbing to the control.

**Enable/Disable** → set
[GuiControl.Enabled](lib/GuiControl.htm#Enabled)

**Hide/Show** → set [GuiControl.Visible](lib/GuiControl.htm#Visible)

**Choose** → [GuiControl.Choose(n)](lib/GuiControl.htm#Choose), where n
is a pure integer. The `|n` or `||n` mode is not supported (use
[ControlChooseIndex](lib/ControlChooseIndex.htm) instead, if needed).

**ChooseString** → [GuiControl.Choose(s)](lib/GuiControl.htm#Choose),
where s is not a pure integer. The `|n` or `||n` mode is not supported
(use [ControlChooseString](lib/ControlChooseString.htm) instead, if
needed). If the string matches multiple items in a multi-select ListBox,
this method selects them all, not just the first.

**Font** → [GuiControl.SetFont()](lib/GuiControl.htm#SetFont)

**+/-Option** → [GuiControl.Opt(\"+/-Option\")](lib/GuiControl.htm#Opt)

### Other Changes

Progress Gui controls no longer have the PBS_SMOOTH style by default, so
they are now styled according to the system visual style.

The default margins and control sizes (particularly for Button controls)
may differ slightly from v1 when DPI is greater than 100 %.

Picture controls no longer delete their current image when they fail to
set a new image via `GuiCtrl.Value := "new image.png"`. However,
removing the current image with `GuiCtrl.Value := ""` is permitted.

[ListView.InsertCol()](lib/ListView.htm#InsertCol)\'s *ColumnNumber*
parameter can now be omitted, which has the same effect as specifying a
column number larger than the number of columns currently in the
control.

## Error Handling

[OnError](lib/OnError.htm) is now called for critical errors prior to
exiting the script. Although the script might not be in a state safe for
execution, the attempt is made, consistent with OnExit.

Runtime errors no longer set `Exception.What` to the currently running
user-defined function or sub (but this is still done when calling
`Error()` without the second parameter). This gives `What` a clearer
purpose: a function name indicates a failure of that function (not a
failure to call the function or evaluate its parameters). `What` is
blank for expression evaluation and control flow errors (some others may
also be blank).

Exception objects thrown by runtime errors can now be identified as
instances of the new Error class or a more specific subclass. Error
objects have a *Stack* property containing a stack trace. If the *What*
parameter specifies the name of a running function, *File* and *Line*
are now set based on which line called that function.

Try-catch syntax has changed to allow the script to catch specific error
classes, while leaving others uncaught. See [Catch](#catch) below for
details.

### Continuable Errors

In most cases, error dialogs now provide the option to continue the
current thread (vs. exiting the thread). COM errors now exit the thread
when choosing not to continue (vs. exiting the entire script).

Scripts should not rely on this: If the error was raised by a built-in
function, continuing causes it to return \"\". If the error was raised
by the expression evaluator (such as for an invalid dynamic reference or
divide by zero), the expression is aborted and yields \"\" (if used as a
control flow statement\'s parameter).

In some cases the code does not support continuation, and the option to
continue should not be shown. The option is also not shown for critical
errors, which are designed to terminate the script.

[OnError](lib/OnError.htm) callbacks now take a second parameter,
containing one of the following values:

-   Return: Returning -1 will continue the thread, while 0 and 1 act as
    before.
-   Exit: Continuation not supported. Returning non-zero stops further
    processing but still exits the thread.
-   ExitApp: This is a critical error. Returning non-zero stops further
    processing but the script is still terminated.

### ErrorLevel

ErrorLevel has been removed. Scripts are often (perhaps usually) written
without error-checking, so the policy of setting ErrorLevel for errors
often let them go undetected. An immediate error message may seem a bit
confrontational, but is generally more helpful.

Where ErrorLevel was previously set to indicate an error condition, an
exception is thrown instead, with a (usually) more helpful error
message.

Commands such as \"Process Exist\" which used it to return a value now
simply return that value (e.g. `pid := ProcessExist()`) or something
more useful (e.g. `hwnd := GroupActivate(group)`).

In some cases ErrorLevel was used for a secondary return value.

-   [Sort](lib/Sort.htm) with the U option no longer returns the number
    of duplicates removed.
-   The Input command was removed. It was superseded by InputHook. A few
    lines of code can make a simple replacement which returns an
    InputHook object containing the results instead of using ErrorLevel
    and an OutputVar.
-   [InputBox](lib/InputBox.htm) returns an object with *Result* (OK,
    Cancel or Timeout) and *Value* properties.

File functions which previously stored the number of failures in
ErrorLevel now throw it in the *Extra* property of the thrown exception
object.

[SendMessage](lib/SendMessage.htm) timeout is usually an anomolous
condition, so causes a [TimeoutError](lib/Error.htm#TimeoutError) to be
thrown. [TargetError](lib/Error.htm#TargetError) and
[OSError](lib/Error.htm#OSError) may be thrown under other conditions.

The UseErrorLevel modes of the [Run](lib/Run.htm) and
[Hotkey](lib/Hotkey.htm) functions were removed. This mode predates the
addition of [Try](lib/Try.htm)/[Catch](lib/Catch.htm) to the language.
Menu and Gui had this mode as well but were replaced with objects (which
do not use ErrorLevel).

### Expressions

A load-time error is raised for more syntax errors than in v1, such as:

-   Empty parentheses (except adjoining a function name); e.g. `x ()`
-   Prefix operator used on the wrong side or lacking an operand; e.g.
    `x!`
-   Binary operator with less than two operands.
-   Ternary operator with less than three operands.
-   Target of assignment not a writable variable or property.

An exception is thrown when any of the following failures occur (instead
of ignoring the failure or producing an empty string):

-   Attempting math on a non-numeric value. (Numeric strings are okay.)
-   Divide by zero or other invalid/unsupported input, such as
    `(-1)**1.5`. Note that some cases are newly detected as invalid,
    such as `0**0` and `a<<b` or `a>>b` where *b* is not in the range
    0..63.
-   Failure to allocate memory for a built-in function\'s return value,
    concatenation or the expression\'s result.
-   Stack underflow (typically caused by a syntax error).
-   Attempted assignment to something which isn\'t a variable (or array
    element).
-   Attempted assignment to a read-only variable.
-   Attempted double-deref with an empty name, such as `fn(%empty%)`.
-   Failure to execute a dynamic function call or method call.
-   A method/property invocation fails because the value does not
    implement that method/property. (For associative arrays in v1, only
    a method call can cause this.)
-   An object-assignment fails due to memory allocation failure.

Some of the conditions above are detected in v1, but not mid-expression;
for instance, `A_AhkPath := x` is detected in v1 but
`y := x, A_AhkPath := x` is only detected in v2.

Standalone use of the operators `+=`, `-=`, `--` and `++` no longer
treats an empty variable as 0. This differs from v1, where they treated
an empty variable as 0 when used standalone, but not mid-expression or
with multi-statement comma.

### Functions

Functions generally throw an exception on failure. In particular:

-   Errors due to incorrect use of [DllCall](lib/DllCall.htm),
    [RegExMatch](lib/RegExMatch.htm) and
    [RegExReplace](lib/RegExReplace.htm) were fairly common due to their
    complexity, and (like many errors) are easier to detect and debug if
    an error message is shown immediately.

-   [Math functions](lib/Math.htm) throw an exception if any of their
    inputs are non-numeric, or if the operation is invalid (such as
    division by zero).

-   Functions with a *WinTitle* parameter (with exceptions, such as
    [WinClose](lib/WinClose.htm)\'s ahk_group mode) throw if the target
    window or control is not found.

Exceptions are thrown for some errors that weren\'t previously detected,
and some conditions that were incorrectly marked as errors (previously
by setting ErrorLevel) were fixed.

Some error messages have been changed.

### Catch

The syntax for [Catch](lib/Catch.htm) has been changed to provide a way
to catch specific error classes, while leaving others uncaught (to
transfer control to another Catch further up the call stack, or report
the error and exit the thread). Previously this required catching thrown
values of all types, then checking type and re-throwing. For example:

    ; Old (uses obsolete v2.0-a rules for demonstration since v1 had no `is` or Error classes)
    try
        SendMessage msg,,, "Control1", "The Window"
    catch err
        if err is TimeoutError
            MsgBox "The Window is unresponsive"
        else
            throw err

    ; New
    try
        SendMessage msg,,, "Control1", "The Window"
    catch TimeoutError
        MsgBox "The Window is unresponsive"

Variations:

-   `catch` catches an Error instance.
-   `catch as err` catches an Error instance, which is assigned to err.
-   `catch ValueError as err` catches a ValueError instance, which is
    assigned to err.
-   `catch ValueError, TypeError` catches either type.
-   `catch ValueError, TypeError as err` catches either type and assigns
    the instance to err.
-   `catch Any` catches anything.
-   `catch (MyError as err)` permits parentheses, like most other
    control flow statements.

If *Try* is used without *Finally* or *Catch*, it acts as though it has
a *Catch* with an empty block. Although that sounds like v1, now *Catch*
on its own only catches instances of [Error](lib/Error.htm). In most
cases, *Try* on its own is meant to suppress an Error, so no change
needs to be made. However, the direct v2 equivalent of v1\'s
`try something()` is the following:

    try something()
    catch Any
    {}

Prioritising the error type over the output variable name might
encourage better code; handling the expected error as intended without
suppressing or mishandling unexpected errors that should have been
reported.

As values of all types can be thrown, any class is valid for the filter
(e.g. `String` or `Map`). However, the class prototypes are resolved at
load time, and must be specified as a full class name and not an
arbitrary expression (similar to `y` in `class x extends y`).

While a *Catch* statement is executing, `throw` (without parameters) can
be used to re-throw the exception (avoiding the need to specify an
output variable just for that purpose). This is supported even within a
nested *Try-Finally*, but not within a nested *Try-Catch*. The `throw`
does not need to be physically contained by the *Catch* statement\'s
body; it can be used by a called function.

An [Else](lib/Else.htm) can be present after the last *Catch*; this is
executed if no exception is thrown within *Try*.

## Keyboard, Mouse, Hotkeys and Hotstrings

Fewer VK to SC and SC to VK mappings are hard-coded, in theory improving
compatibility with non-conventional custom keyboard layouts.

The key names \"Return\" and \"Break\" were removed. Use \"Enter\" and
\"Pause\" instead.

The presence of [AltGr]{.kbd} on each keyboard layout is now always
detected by reading the KLLF_ALTGR flag from the keyboard layout DLL.
(v1.1.28+ Unicode builds already use this method.) The fallback methods
of detecting [AltGr]{.kbd} via the keyboard hook have been removed.

Mouse wheel hotkeys set [A_EventInfo](Variables.htm#EventInfo) to the
wheel delta as reported by the mouse driver instead of dividing by 120.
Generally it is a multiple of 120, but some mouse hardware/drivers may
report wheel movement at a higher resolution.

Hotstrings now treat [Shift]{.kbd}+[Backspace]{.kbd} the same as
[Backspace]{.kbd}, instead of transcribing it to `` `b `` within the
hotstring buffer.

Hotstrings use the first pair of colons (`::`{.no-highlight}) as a
delimiter rather than the last when multiple pairs of colons are
present. In other words, colons (when adjacent to another colon) must be
escaped in the trigger text in v2, whereas in v1 they must be escaped in
the replacement. Note that with an odd number of consecutive colons, the
previous behaviour did not consider the final colon as part of a pair.
For example, there is no change in behaviour for
`::1:::2`{.no-highlight} (`1`{.no-highlight} → `:2`{.no-highlight}), but
`::3::::4`{.no-highlight} is now `3`{.no-highlight} →
`::4`{.no-highlight} rather than `3::`{.no-highlight} →
`4`{.no-highlight}.

Hotstrings no longer escape colons in pairs, which means it is now
possible to escape a single colon at the end of the hotstring trigger.
For example, `` ::5`:::6 ``{.no-highlight} is now `5:`{.no-highlight} →
`6`{.no-highlight} rather than an error, and
`` ::7`::::8 ``{.no-highlight} is now `7:`{.no-highlight} →
`:8`{.no-highlight} rather than `7::`{.no-highlight} →
`8`{.no-highlight}. It is best to escape every literal colon in these
cases to avoid confusion (but a single isolated colon need not be
escaped).

Hotstrings with continuation sections now default to Text mode instead
of Raw mode.

Hotkeys now mask the Win/Alt key on release only if it is logically down
and the hotkey requires the Win/Alt key (with `#`/`!` or a custom
prefix). That is, hotkeys which do not require the Win/Alt key no longer
mask Win/Alt-up when the Win/Alt key is physically down. This allows
hotkeys which send `{Blind}{LWin up}` to activate the Start menu (which
was already possible if using a remapped key such as `AppsKey::RWin`).

## Other

Windows 2000 and Windows XP support has been dropped.

AutoHotkey no longer overrides the system `ForegroundLockTimeout`
setting at startup.

-   This was done by calling `SystemParametersInfo` with the
    `SPI_SETFOREGROUNDLOCKTIMEOUT` action, which affects all
    applications for the current user session. It does not persist after
    logout, but was still undesirable to some users.

-   User bug reports (and simple logic) indicate that if it works, it
    allows the focus to be stolen by programs which aren\'t specifically
    designed to do so.

-   Some testing on Windows 10 indicated that it had no effect on
    anything; calls to `SetForegroundWindow` always failed, and other
    workarounds employed by WinActivate were needed and effective
    regardless of timeout. `SPI_GETFOREGROUNDLOCKTIMEOUT` was used from
    a separate process to verify that the change took effect (it
    sometimes doesn\'t).

-   It can be replicated in script easily:

        DllCall("SystemParametersInfo", "int", 0x2001, "int", 0, "ptr", 0, "int", 2)

RegEx newline matching defaults to (\*ANYCRLF) and (\*BSR_ANYCRLF); \`r
and \`n are recognized in addition to \`r\`n. The \`a option implicitly
enables (\*BSR_UNICODE).

RegEx callout functions can now be variadic. Callouts specified via a
`pcre_callout` variable can be any callable object, or `pcre_callout`
itself can be directly defined as a function (perhaps a nested
function). As the function and variable [namespaces were
merged](#scope), a callout pattern such as `(?C:fn)` can also refer to a
local or global variable containing a function object, not just a
user-defined function.

Scripts read from stdin (e.g. with `AutoHotkey.exe *`) no longer include
the initial working directory in
[A_ScriptFullPath](Variables.htm#ScriptFullPath) or the main window\'s
title, but it is used as [A_ScriptDir](Variables.htm#ScriptDir) and to
locate the local Lib folder.

Settings changed by the [auto-execute thread](Scripts.htm#auto) now
become the default settings immediately (for threads launched after that
point), rather than after 100 ms and then again when the auto-execute
thread finishes.

The following limits have been removed by utilizing dynamic allocations:

-   Maximum line or continuation section length of 16,383 characters.
-   Maximum 512 tokens per expression (MAX_TOKENS).\
    Arrays internal to the expression evaluator which were sized based
    on MAX_TOKENS are now based on precalculated estimates of the
    required sizes, so performance should be similar but stack usage is
    somewhat lower in most cases. This might increase the maximum
    recursion depth of user-defined functions.
-   Maximum 512 var or function references per arg (but MAX_TOKENS was
    more limiting for expressions anyway).
-   Maximum 255 specified parameter values per function call (but
    MAX_TOKENS was more limiting anyway).

[ListVars](lib/ListVars.htm) now shows static variables separately to
local variables. Global variables declared within the function are also
listed as static variables (this is a side-effect of new implementation
details, but is kept as it might be useful in scripts with many global
variables).

The (undocumented?) \"lazy var\" optimization was removed to reduce code
size and maintenance costs. This optimization improved performance of
scripts with more than 100,000 variables.

[Tray menu](Program.htm#tray-icon): The word \"This\" was removed from
\"Reload This Script\" and \"Edit This Script\", for consistency with
\"Pause Script\" and the main window\'s menu options.

YYYYMMDDHH24MISS timestamp values are now considered invalid if their
length is not an even number between 4 and 14 (inclusive).

### Persistence

Scripts are \"[persistent](lib/Persistent.htm)\" while at least one of
the following conditions is satisfied:

-   At least one hotkey or hotstring has been defined by the script.
-   At least one [Gui](lib/Gui.htm) (or the script\'s [main
    window](Program.htm#main-window)) is visible.
-   At least one script [timer](lib/SetTimer.htm) is currently enabled.
-   At least one [OnClipboardChange](lib/OnClipboardChange.htm) callback
    function has been set.
-   At least one [InputHook](lib/InputHook.htm) is active.
-   `Persistent()` or `Persistent(true)` was called and not reversed by
    calling `Persistent(false)`.

If one of the following occurs and none of the above conditions are
satisfied, the script terminates.

-   The last script thread finishes.
-   A [Gui](lib/Gui.htm) is closed or destroyed.
-   The script\'s [main window](Program.htm#main-window) is closed (but
    destroying it causes the script to exit regardless of persistence,
    as before).
-   An [InputHook](lib/InputHook.htm) with no
    [OnEnd](lib/InputHook.htm#OnEnd) callback ends.

For flexibility, [OnMessage](lib/OnMessage.htm) does not make the script
automatically persistent.

By contrast, v1 scripts are \"persistent\" when at least one of the
following is true:

-   At least one hotkey or hotstring has been defined by the script.
-   Gui or OnMessage() appears anywhere in the script.
-   The keyboard hook or mouse hook is installed.
-   Input has been called.
-   #Persistent was used.

### Threads

[Threads](misc/Threads.htm) start out with an uninterruptible timeout of
17 ms instead of 15 ms. 15 was too low since the system tick count
updates in steps of 15 or 16 minimum; i.e. if the tick count updated at
exactly the wrong moment, the thread could become interruptible even
though virtually no time had passed.

Threads which start out uninterruptible now remain so until at least one
line has executed, even if the uninterruptible timeout expires first
(such as if the system suspends the process immediately after the thread
starts in order to give CPU time to another process).

[#MaxThreads](lib/_MaxThreads.htm) and
[#MaxThreadsPerHotkey](lib/_MaxThreadsPerHotkey.htm) no longer make
exceptions for any subroutine whose first line is one of the following
functions: [ExitApp](lib/ExitApp.htm), [Pause](lib/Pause.htm),
[Edit](lib/Edit.htm), [Reload](lib/Reload.htm),
[KeyHistory](lib/KeyHistory.htm), [ListLines](lib/ListLines.htm),
[ListVars](lib/ListVars.htm), or [ListHotkeys](lib/ListHotkeys.htm).

### Default Settings

-   [#NoEnv is the default behaviour, so the directive itself has been
    removed. Use [EnvGet](lib/EnvGet.htm) instead if an equivalent
    built-in variable is not available.]{#NoEnv}
-   [SendMode](lib/SendMode.htm) defaults to Input instead of Event.
-   [Title matching mode](lib/SetTitleMatchMode.htm) defaults to 2
    instead of 1.
-   [SetBatchLines has been removed, so all scripts run at full speed
    (equivalent to SetBatchLines -1 in v1).]{#SetBatchLines}
-   The working directory defaults to
    [A_ScriptDir](Variables.htm#ScriptDir).
    [A_InitialWorkingDir](Variables.htm#InitialWorkingDir) contains the
    working directory which was set by the process which launched
    AutoHotkey.
-   [#SingleInstance](lib/_SingleInstance.htm) prompt behaviour is
    default for all scripts; #SingleInstance on its own activates Force
    mode. `#SingleInstance Prompt` can also be used explicitly, for
    clarity or to override a previous directive.
-   [CoordMode](lib/CoordMode.htm) defaults to Client (added in v1.1.05)
    instead of Window.
-   The default codepage for script files (but not files read *by* the
    script) is now UTF-8 instead of ANSI (CP0). This can be overridden
    with the /CP command line switch, as before.
-   [#MaxMem was removed, and no artificial limit is placed on variable
    capacity.]{#MaxMem}

### Default Script

When an AutoHotkey program file (such as AutoHotkey32.exe or
AutoHotkey64.exe) is launched without specifying a script file, it no
longer searches the user\'s Documents folder for a [default script
file](Scripts.htm#defaultfile).

AutoHotkey is not intended to be used by directly launching the program
file, except when using a [portable copy](Program.htm#portability).
Instead of running the program file, you should generally [run an .ahk
file](Program.htm#run).

If you are creating a shortcut to a specific program file, you can
append a space and the path of a script (generally enclosed by quote
marks) to the shortcut\'s target.

### Command Line

Command-line args are no longer stored in a pseudo-array of numbered
global vars; the global variable [A_Args](Variables.htm#Args) (added in
v1.1.27) should be used instead.

The /R and /F switches were removed. Use /restart and /force instead.

/validate should be used in place of /iLib when AutoHotkey.exe is being
used to check a script for syntax errors, as the function library
auto-include mechanism was removed.

/ErrorStdOut is now treated as one of the script\'s parameters, not
built-in, in either of the following cases:

-   When the script is compiled, unless /script is used.
-   When it has a suffix not beginning with `=` (where previously the
    suffix was ignored).
