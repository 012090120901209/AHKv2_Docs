# How to Install AutoHotkey

If you have not already downloaded AutoHotkey, you can get it from one
of the following locations:

-   <https://www.autohotkey.com/> - multiple options are presented when
    you click Download.
-   <https://www.autohotkey.com/download/> - the main download links are
    for the current exe installer, but there are also links to the
    current zip package and archive of older versions.

**Note:** This tutorial is for AutoHotkey v2.

The main download has a filename like `AutoHotkey_2.0_setup.exe`. Run
this file to begin installing AutoHotkey.

If you are not the administrator of your computer, you may need to
select the *Current user* option.

Otherwise, the recommended options are already filled in, so just click
**Install**.

**For users of v1:** AutoHotkey v2 includes a launcher which allows
multiple versions of AutoHotkey to co-exist while sharing one file
extension (`.ahk`). Installing AutoHotkey v1 and v2 into different
directories is not necessary and is currently not supported.

If you are installing for *all users*, you will need to provide
administrator consent in the standard UAC prompt that appears (in other
words, click *Yes*).

If there were no complications, AutoHotkey is now installed!

Once installation completes, the [Dash](../Program.htm#dash) is shown
automatically.

## Next Steps {#Next_Steps}

[Using the Program](../Program.htm) covers the basics of how to use
AutoHotkey.

Consider installing an [editor with AutoHotkey
support](../misc/Editors.htm) to make editing and testing scripts much
easier.

The documentation contains many examples, which you can test out as
described in [How to Run Example Code](RunExamples.htm).

These tutorials focus on specific common tasks:

-   [How to Run Programs](RunPrograms.htm)
-   [How to Write Hotkeys](WriteHotkeys.htm)
-   [How to Send Keystrokes](SendKeys.htm)

[AutoHotkey Beginner Tutorial by tidbit](../Tutorial.htm) covers a range

## Problems? {#Problems}

If you have problems installing AutoHotkey, please try searching for

new topic to get help or report the issue.

## Zip Installer {#Zip_Installer}

AutoHotkey can also be installed from the zip download.

1.  Open the zip file using File Explorer (no extraction necessary), or
    extract the contents of the zip file to a temporary directory.
2.  Run **Install.cmd**.
3.  If you receive a prompt like \"The publisher could not be verified.
    Are you sure\...?\", click Run.
4.  Continue installation as described above.

## Security Prompts {#Security_Prompts}

You may receive one or more security prompts, depending on several
factors.

### Web Browsers {#Web_Browsers}

Common web browsers may show a warning like \"AutoHotkey_2.0_setup.exe
was blocked because it could harm your device.\" This is a generic
warning that applies to any executable file type that isn\'t \"commonly
downloaded\". In other words, it often happens for new releases of
software, until more users have downloaded that particular version.

To keep the download, methods vary between browsers. Look for a menu
button near where downloads are shown, or try right clicking on the
blocked download.

Sometimes the download might be blocked due to an antivirus
false-positive; in that case, see [Antivirus](#Antivirus) below.

The Google Safe Browsing service (also used by other browsers) has been
known to show false warnings about AutoHotkey. For details, see [Safe
Browsing](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/safe.htm).

### SmartScreen {#SmartScreen}

Microsoft Defender SmartScreen may show a prompt like \"Windows
protected your PC\". This is common for software from open source
developers and Independent Software Vendors (ISV), especially soon after
the release of each new version. The following blog article by Louis
Kessler describes the problem well: [That's not very Smart of you,
Microsoft](https://www.beholdgenealogy.com/blog/?p=3823)

To continue installation, select *More info* and then *Run anyway*.

### Antivirus {#Antivirus}

If your antivirus flags the download as malicious, please refer to the
following:

-   [FAQ: My antivirus program flagged AutoHotkey or a compiled script
    as malware. Is it really a virus?](../FAQ.htm#Virus)
-   [Report False-Positives To Anti-Virus
    Companies](https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=62266&start=80)
