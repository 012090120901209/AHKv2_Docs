## General

### Remap easy to reach but rarely used keys {#easy-to-reach}

Some of the easiest keys to reach on the keyboard are also the least
frequently used. Make these keys do something useful! For example, if
you rarely use the right [Alt]{.kbd}, make it perform the action you do
most often:

    RAlt::MsgBox "You pressed the right ALT key."

You can even do the above without losing the native function of the
right [Alt]{.kbd} by assigning the right [Alt]{.kbd} to be a \"prefix\"
for at least one other hotkey. In the below example, the right
[Alt]{.kbd} has become a prefix, which automatically allows it to modify
**all** other keys as it normally would. But if you press and release
the right [Alt]{.kbd} without having used it to modify another key, its
hotkey action (above) will take effect immediately:

    RAlt & j::AltTab

### Use any keys as modifiers {#keys-as-modifiers}

Don\'t be limited to using only [Ctrl]{.kbd}, [Alt]{.kbd},
[Shift]{.kbd}, and [Win]{.kbd} as modifiers; you can combine **any** two
keys or mouse buttons to form a custom hotkey. For example: Hold down
Numpad0 and press Numpad1 to launch a hotkey (`Numpad0 & Numpad1::`);
hold down [CapsLock]{.kbd} and press another key, or click a mouse
button (`CapsLock & RButton::`). In this case, [CapsLock]{.kbd}\'s state
(on or off) is not changed when it is used to launch the hotkey. For
details, see [custom combinations of keys](Hotkeys.htm#combo).

### Make the mouse wheel perform alt-tabbing {#AltTab}

Convert the mouse wheel (or any other keys of your choice) into a
complete substitute for Alt-Tab. Click the wheel to show or hide the
menu, and turn it to navigate through the menu. The wheel will still
function normally whenever the Alt-Tab menu isn\'t visible. Syntax:

    MButton::AltTabMenu
    WheelDown::AltTab
    WheelUp::ShiftAltTab

### Make a keyboard key become a mouse button {#keyboard-to-mouse}

Make a keyboard key **become** a mouse button, or have an action
repeated continuously while you\'re holding down a key or mouse button.
See the [remapping page](misc/Remap.htm#RemapMouse) for examples.

### Make your hotkeys context-sensitive {#context-sensitive}

Have your easiest-to-reach hotkeys perform an action appropriate to the
type of window you\'re working with. In the following example, the right
[Ctrl]{.kbd} performs a different action depending on whether Notepad or
Calculator is the active window:

    #HotIf WinActive("ahk_class Notepad")
    RControl::Send "^s"  ; Save the current file in Notepad.

    #HotIf WinActive("Calculator")
    RControl::Send "^c!{tab}^v"  ; Copy the Calculator's result into the previously active window.

See [#HotIf](lib/_HotIf.htm) for details.

### Define abbreviations that expand as you type them {#hotstrings}

Also known as [hotstrings](Hotstrings.htm). No special training or
scripting experience is needed. For example, a script containing the
following lines would expand ceo, cfo, and btw wherever you type them:

    ::ceo::Chief Executive Officer
    ::cfo::Chief Financial Officer
    ::btw::by the way

## Gaming

### Reduce wear and tear on your fingers {#wear-and-tear}

Reduce wear and tear on your fingers by using virtually [any
key](KeyList.htm) as a hotkey, including single letters, arrow keys,
Numpad keys, and even the modifier keys themselves (Ctrl, Alt, Win, and
Shift).

### Create mouse hotkeys {#mouse-hotkeys}

Create mouse hotkeys, including the mouse wheel button (MButton) and the
turning of the wheel up/down or left/right (WheelUp, WheelDown,
WheelLeft, and WheelRight). You can also combine a keyboard key with a
mouse button. For example, control-right-button would be expressed as
`^RButton::`.

### Create \"pass-through\" hotkeys {#pass-through}

For example, the left mouse button can trigger a hotkey action even
while the click itself is being sent into the game normally (syntax:
`~LButton::`).

### Automate game actions on the screen {#game-actions}

Use functions such as [PixelSearch](lib/PixelSearch.htm),
[PixelGetColor](lib/PixelGetColor.htm), and
[ImageSearch](lib/ImageSearch.htm) to automate game actions.

### Use the keyboard hook {#keyboard-hook}

Have the option of using the [keyboard hook](lib/_UseHook.htm) to
implement hotkeys, which might be more responsive than other hotkey
methods while the CPU is under load in a game. The hook might also be
able to override any restrictions a game may have about which keys can
be \"mapped\" to game actions.
