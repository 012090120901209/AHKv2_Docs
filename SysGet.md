  Number   Description
  -------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  80       SM_CMONITORS: Number of display monitors on the desktop (not including \"non-display pseudo-monitors\").
  43       SM_CMOUSEBUTTONS: Number of buttons on mouse (0 if no mouse is installed).
  16, 17   SM_CXFULLSCREEN, SM_CYFULLSCREEN: Width and height of the client area for a full-screen window on the primary display monitor, in pixels.
  61, 62   SM_CXMAXIMIZED, SM_CYMAXIMIZED: Default dimensions, in pixels, of a maximized top-level window on the primary display monitor.
  59, 60   SM_CXMAXTRACK, SM_CYMAXTRACK: Default maximum dimensions of a window that has a caption and sizing borders, in pixels. This metric refers to the entire desktop. The user cannot drag the window frame to a size larger than these dimensions.
  28, 29   SM_CXMIN, SM_CYMIN: Minimum width and height of a window, in pixels.
  57, 58   SM_CXMINIMIZED, SM_CYMINIMIZED: Dimensions of a minimized window, in pixels.
  34, 35   SM_CXMINTRACK, SM_CYMINTRACK: Minimum tracking width and height of a window, in pixels. The user cannot drag the window frame to a size smaller than these dimensions. A window can override these values by processing the WM_GETMINMAXINFO message.
  0, 1     SM_CXSCREEN, SM_CYSCREEN: Width and height of the screen of the primary display monitor, in pixels. These are the same as the built-in variables [A_ScreenWidth](../Variables.htm#Screen) and [A_ScreenHeight](../Variables.htm#Screen).
  78, 79   SM_CXVIRTUALSCREEN, SM_CYVIRTUALSCREEN: Width and height of the virtual screen, in pixels. The virtual screen is the bounding rectangle of all display monitors. The SM_XVIRTUALSCREEN, SM_YVIRTUALSCREEN metrics are the coordinates of the top-left corner of the virtual screen.
  19       SM_MOUSEPRESENT: Nonzero if a mouse is installed; zero otherwise.
  75       SM_MOUSEWHEELPRESENT: Nonzero if a mouse with a wheel is installed; zero otherwise.
  63       SM_NETWORK: Least significant bit is set if a network is present; otherwise, it is cleared. The other bits are reserved for future use.
  8193     SM_REMOTECONTROL: This system metric is used in a Terminal Services environment. Its value is nonzero if the current session is remotely controlled; zero otherwise.
  4096     SM_REMOTESESSION: This system metric is used in a Terminal Services environment. If the calling process is associated with a Terminal Services client session, the return value is nonzero. If the calling process is associated with the Terminal Server console session, the return value is zero. The console session is not necessarily the physical console.
  70       SM_SHOWSOUNDS: Nonzero if the user requires an application to present information visually in situations where it would otherwise present the information only in audible form; zero otherwise.
  8192     SM_SHUTTINGDOWN: Nonzero if the current session is shutting down; zero otherwise. **Windows 2000:** The retrieved value is always 0.
  23       SM_SWAPBUTTON: Nonzero if the meanings of the left and right mouse buttons are swapped; zero otherwise.
  76, 77   SM_XVIRTUALSCREEN, SM_YVIRTUALSCREEN: Coordinates for the left side and the top of the virtual screen. The virtual screen is the bounding rectangle of all display monitors. By contrast, the SM_CXVIRTUALSCREEN, SM_CYVIRTUALSCREEN metrics (further above) are the width and height of the virtual screen.
