# ImageSearch

Searches a region of the screen for an image.

``` Syntax
ImageSearch &OutputVarX, &OutputVarY, X1, Y1, X2, Y2, ImageFile
```

## Parameters {#Parameters}

&OutputVarX, &OutputVarY

:   Type: [VarRef](../Concepts.htm#variable-references)

    References to the output variables in which to store the X and Y
    coordinates of the upper-left pixel of where the image was found on
    the screen (if no match is found, the variables are made blank).
    Coordinates are relative to the active window\'s client area unless
    [CoordMode](CoordMode.htm) was used to change that.

X1, Y1

:   Type: [Integer](../Concepts.htm#numbers)

    The X and Y coordinates of the upper left corner of the rectangle to
    search. Coordinates are relative to the active window\'s client area
    unless [CoordMode](CoordMode.htm) was used to change that.

X2, Y2

:   Type: [Integer](../Concepts.htm#numbers)

    The X and Y coordinates of the lower right corner of the rectangle
    to search. Coordinates are relative to the active window\'s client
    area unless [CoordMode](CoordMode.htm) was used to change that.

ImageFile

:   Type: [String](../Concepts.htm#strings)

    The file name of an image, which is assumed to be in
    [A_WorkingDir](../Variables.htm#WorkingDir) if an absolute path
    isn\'t specified. Supported image formats include ANI, BMP, CUR,
    EMF, Exif, GIF, ICO, JPG, PNG, TIF, and WMF (BMP images must be
    16-bit or higher). Other sources of icons include the following
    types of files: EXE, DLL, CPL, SCR, and other types that contain
    icon resources.

    **Options:** Zero or more of the following options may be also be
    present immediately before the name of the file. Separate each
    option from the next with a single space or tab. For example:
    `"*2 *w100 *h-1 C:\Main Logo.bmp"`.

    **\*Icon***N*: To use an icon group other than the first one in the
    file, specify `*Icon` followed immediately by the number of the
    group. For example, `*Icon2` would load the default icon from the
    second icon group.

    **\**n*** (variation): Specify for *n* a number between 0 and 255
    (inclusive) to indicate the allowed number of shades of variation in
    either direction for the intensity of the red, green, and blue
    components of each pixel\'s color. For example, if
    `*2`{.no-highlight} is specified and the color of a pixel is
    0x444444, any color from 0x424242 to 0x464646 will be considered a
    match. This parameter is helpful if the coloring of the image varies
    slightly or if *ImageFile* uses a format such as GIF or JPG that
    does not accurately represent an image on the screen. If you specify
    255 shades of variation, all colors will match. The default is 0
    shades.

    **\*Trans***N*: This option makes it easier to find a match by
    specifying one color within the image that will match any color on
    the screen. It is most commonly used to find PNG, GIF, and TIF files
    that have some transparent areas (however, icons do not need this
    option because their transparency is automatically supported). For
    GIF files, `*TransWhite` might be most likely to work. For PNG and
    TIF files, `*TransBlack` might be best. Otherwise, specify for *N*
    some other color name or RGB value (see the [color
    chart](../misc/Colors.htm) for guidance, or use
    [PixelGetColor](PixelGetColor.htm) in its RGB mode). Examples:
    `*TransBlack`, `*TransFFFFAA`, `*Trans0xFFFFAA`.

    **\*w***n* and **\*h***n*: Width and height to which to scale the
    image (this width and height also determines which icon to load from
    a multi-icon .ICO file). If both these options are omitted, icons
    loaded from ICO, DLL, or EXE files are scaled to the system\'s
    default small-icon size, which is usually 16 by 16 (you can force
    the actual/internal size to be used by specifying `*w0 *h0`). Images
    that are not icons are loaded at their actual size. To shrink or
    enlarge the image while preserving its aspect ratio, specify -1 for
    one of the dimensions and a positive number for the other. For
    example, specifying `*w200 *h-1`{.no-highlight} would make the image
    200 pixels wide and cause its height to be set automatically.

    A [bitmap or icon handle](../misc/ImageHandles.htm) can be used
    instead of a filename. For example, `"HBITMAP:*" handle`.

## Return Value {#Return_Value}

Type: [Integer (boolean)](../Concepts.htm#boolean)

This function returns 1 (true) if the image was found in the specified
region, or 0 (false) if it was not found.

## Error Handling {#Error_Handling}

A [ValueError](Error.htm#ValueError) is thrown if an invalid parameter
was detected or the image could not be loaded.

An [OSError](Error.htm#OSError) is thrown if an internal function call
fails.

## Remarks {#Remarks}

ImageSearch can be used to detect graphical objects on the screen that
either lack text or whose text cannot be easily retrieved. For example,
it can be used to discover the position of picture buttons, icons, web
page links, or game objects. Once located, such objects can be clicked
via [Click](Click.htm).

A strategy that is sometimes useful is to search for a small clipping
from an image rather than the entire image. This can improve reliability
in cases where the image as a whole varies, but certain parts within it
are always the same. One way to extract a clipping is to:

1.  Press [Alt]{.kbd}+[PrtSc]{.kbd} while the image is visible in the
    active window. This places a screenshot on the clipboard.
2.  Open an image processing program such as Paint.
3.  Paste the contents of the clipboard (that is, the screenshot).
4.  Select a region that does not vary and that is unique to the image.
5.  Copy and paste that region to a new image document.
6.  Save it as a small file for use with ImageSearch.

To be a match, an image on the screen must be the same size as the one
loaded via the *ImageFile* parameter and its options.

The region to be searched must be visible; in other words, it is not
possible to search a region of a window hidden behind another window. By
contrast, images that lie partially beneath the mouse cursor can usually
be detected. The exception to this is game cursors, which in most cases
will obstruct any images beneath them.

Since the search starts at the top row of the region and moves downward,
if there is more than one match, the one closest to the top will be
found.

Icons containing a transparent color automatically allow that color to
match any color on the screen. Therefore, the color of what lies behind
the icon does not matter.

ImageSearch supports 8-bit color screens (256-color) or higher.

The search behavior may vary depending on the display adapter\'s color
depth (especially for GIF and JPG files). Therefore, if a script will
run under multiple color depths, it is best to test it on each depth
setting. You can use the shades-of-variation option (\*n) to help make
the behavior consistent across multiple color depths.

If the image on the screen is translucent, ImageSearch will probably
fail to find it. To work around this, try the shades-of-variation option
(\*n) or make the window temporarily opaque via
[`WinSetTransparent`](WinSetTransparent.htm)`("Off")`.
