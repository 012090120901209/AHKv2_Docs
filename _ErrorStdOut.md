# #ErrorStdOut

Sends any syntax error that prevents a script from launching to the
standard error stream (stderr) rather than displaying a dialog.

``` Syntax
#ErrorStdOut Encoding
```

## Parameters {#Parameters}

Encoding

:   Type: [String](../Concepts.htm#strings)

    If omitted, it defaults to CP0 (the system default ANSI code page).
    Otherwise, specify an [encoding string](FileEncoding.htm) indicating
    how to encode the output. For example, `#ErrorStdOut "UTF-8"`
    encodes error messages as UTF-8 before sending them to stderr.
    Whatever program is capturing the output must support UTF-8, and in
    some cases may need to be configured to expect it.

    **Note:** This parameter is not an expression, but can be enclosed
    in quote marks (either \'single\' or \"double\").

## Remarks {#Remarks}

If this directive is unspecified in the script, any syntax error is
displayed in a dialog.

Errors are written to stderr instead of stdout. The command prompt and
fancy editors usually display both.

This allows fancy editors such as TextPad, SciTE, Crimson, and EditPlus
to jump to the offending line when a syntax error occurs. Since the
#ErrorStdOut directive would have to be added to every script, it is
usually better to set up your editor to use the [command line
switch](../Scripts.htm#cmd) **/ErrorStdOut** when launching any
AutoHotkey script (see further below for setup instructions).

Because AutoHotkey is not a console program, errors will not appear at
the command prompt directly. This can be worked around by 1) compiling
the script with the [Ahk2Exe ConsoleApp
directive](../misc/Ahk2ExeDirectives.htm#ConsoleApp), or 2) capturing
the script\'s output via piping or redirection. For example:

``` no-highlight
"C:\Program Files\AutoHotkey\AutoHotkey.exe" /ErrorStdOut "My Script.ahk" 2>&1 |more
"C:\Program Files\AutoHotkey\AutoHotkey.exe" /ErrorStdOut "My Script.ahk" 2>"Syntax-Error Log.txt"
```

You can also pipe the output directly to the clipboard by using the
operating system\'s built-in clip command. For example:

``` no-highlight
"C:\Program Files\AutoHotkey\AutoHotkey.exe" /ErrorStdOut "My Script.ahk" 2>&1 |clip
```

**Note:** `2>&1` causes stderr to be redirected to stdout, while
`2>`*`Filename`* redirects only stderr to a file.

Like other directives, #ErrorStdOut cannot be executed conditionally.

## Instructions for specific editors {#Instructions_for_specific_editors}

**EditPlus:**

1.  From the menu bar, select Tools \> Configure User Tools.
2.  Press button: Add Tool \> Program

4.  Command: `C:\Program Files\AutoHotkey\AutoHotkey.exe`
5.  Argument: `/ErrorStdOut "$(FilePath)"`{.no-highlight}
6.  Initial directory: `$(FileDir)`
7.  Capture output: Yes

**TextPad:**

1.  From the menu bar, select Configure \> Preferences.
2.  Expand the Tools entry.
3.  Press the Add button and select \"Program\".
4.  Copy and paste (adjust to your path): `C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe`
    \-- then press OK.
5.  Triple-click the newly added item (cmd.exe) in the ListBox and
    rename it to your choice (e.g. Launch Script).
6.  Press Apply.

    information:
8.  Command (should already be filled in): `cmd.exe` (or the full path
    to it)
9.  Parameters (adjust to your path, if necessary):
    `/c ""C:\Program Files\AutoHotkey\AutoHotkey.exe" /ErrorStdOut "$File""`{.no-highlight}
