# Editors with AutoHotkey Support

Any text editor can be used to edit an AutoHotkey script, but editors
which are (or can be configured to be) more AutoHotkey-aware tend to
make reading, editing and testing scripts much easier. AutoHotkey-aware
editors may provide:

-   Syntax highlighting, like what is used in this documentation. With
    syntax highlighting, words, symbols and segments of code are
    colour-coded to indicate their meaning. For instance, literal text,
    comments and variable names are displayed in different colours.
-   Auto-complete, which typically offers a list of suggestions when you
    start typing the name of a known function or variable.
-   Calltips may show you what the parameters are for a function while
    you are writing code to call the function.
-   [Interactive debugging](../Scripts.htm#idebug), such as to step
    through the script line by line and inspect variables at each step,
    or to view and modify variables or objects, beyond what
    [ListVars](../lib/ListVars.htm) allows.

Recommendations:

-   SciTE4AutoHotkey is simple to install, relatively light-weight, and
    fully supports AutoHotkey v1 and v2 without further configuration.
-   VS Code (plus extensions) provides an even higher level of support
    and a wider range of features, but can be heavy on resources.

## SciTE4AutoHotkey {#SciTE4AutoHotkey}

SciTE4AutoHotkey is a custom version of the text editor known as SciTE.
Its features include:

-   Syntax highlighting
-   Auto-complete
-   Calltips
-   Smart auto-indent
-   Code folding

## Visual Studio Code (VS Code) {#Visual_Studio_Code_VS_Code}

Visual Studio Code can be configured with a high level of support for
AutoHotkey by installing extensions.

[AutoHotkey2 Language
Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=thqby.vscode-autohotkey2-lsp)
provides many features, including:

-   Syntax highlighting
-   Auto-complete
-   Calltips
-   Smart auto-indent
-   Code folding
-   Running the script by pressing a hotkey
-   Real-time diagnostics (detecting common errors)
-   Formatting/tidying code

Additional notes:

-   This extension only supports AutoHotkey v2, but can also detect v1
    scripts and automatically switch over to a v1 extension if one is
    installed.
-   This extension can also be used with other editors, such as **vim**,
    **neovim** and **Sublime Text 4**. For details, see [Use in other
    editors](https://github.com/thqby/vscode-autohotkey2-lsp#use-in-other-editors).
    However, VS Code likely provides the best experience, with easiest
    setup.

[vscode-autohotkey-debug](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zero-plusplus.vscode-autohotkey-debug)
provides support for interactive debugging of v1 and v2 scripts.
