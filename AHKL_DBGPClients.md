# Debugging Clients

Additional debugging features are supported via
[DBGp](https://xdebug.org/docs/dbgp), a common debugger protocol for
languages and debugger UI communication. See [Interactive
Debugging](Scripts.htm#idebug) for more details. Some UIs or \"clients\"
known to be compatible with AutoHotkey are listed on this page:

-   [SciTE4AutoHotkey](#SciTE4AutoHotkey)
-   [XDebugClient](#XDebugClient)
-   [Notepad++ DBGp Plugin](#Notepad++)
-   [Script-based Clients](#dbgp.ahk)
-   [Command-line Client](#command-line-client)
-   [Others](#others)

## SciTE4AutoHotkey {#SciTE4AutoHotkey}

[SciTE4AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/scite4ahk/) is a free,
[SciTE](https://www.scintilla.org/SciTE.html)-based AutoHotkey script
editor. In addition to DBGp support, it provides syntax highlighting,
calltips/parameter info and auto-complete for AutoHotkey, and other
useful editing features and scripting tools.

Debugging features include:

-   Breakpoints.
-   Run, Step Over/Into/Out.
-   View the call stack.
-   List name and contents of variables in local/global scope.
-   Hover over variable to show contents.
-   Inspect or edit variable contents.
-   View structure of objects.

## Visual Studio Code {#VSCode}

The
[vscode-autohotkey-debug](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zero-plusplus.vscode-autohotkey-debug)
extension enables [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
to act as a debugger client for AutoHotkey. The extension has support
for all basic debugging features as well as some more advanced features,
such as breakpoint directives (as comments) and conditional breakpoints.

## XDebugClient {#XDebugClient}

[XDebugClient](https://code.google.com/archive/p/xdebugclient/) is a
simple open-source front-end DBGp client based on the **.NET Framework
2.0**. XDebugClient was originally designed for PHP with Xdebug, but a
custom build compatible with AutoHotkey is available below.

**Changes:**

-   Allow the debugger engine to report a language other than \"php\".
-   Added AutoHotkey syntax highlighting.
-   Automatically listen for a connection from the debugger engine,
    rather than waiting for the user to click *Start Listening*.
-   Truncate property values at the first null-character, since
    AutoHotkey currently returns the entire variable contents and
    XDebugClient has no suitable interface for displaying binary
    content.

**Download:**
[Binary](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/tools/XDebugClient.zip);
[Source
Code](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/tools/XDebugClient_src.zip)
(also see [SharpDevelop](https://github.com/icsharpcode), [Dockpanel
Suite](https://sourceforge.net/projects/dockpanelsuite/) and [Advanced
TreeView](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/14741/Advanced-TreeView-for-NET).)

**Usage:**

-   Launch XDebugClient.
-   Launch AutoHotkey /Debug. XDebugClient should automatically open the
    script file.
-   Click the left margin to set at least one breakpoint.
-   Choose Run from the Debug menu, or press [F5]{.kbd}.
-   When execution hits a breakpoint, use the Debug menu or shortcut
    keys to step through or resume the script.

**Features:**

-   Syntax highlighted, read-only view of the source code.
-   Breakpoints.
-   Run, Step Over/Into/Out.
-   View the call stack.
-   Inspect variables - select a variable name, right-click, Inspect.

**Issues:**

-   The user interface does not respond to user input while the script
    is running.
-   No mechanisms are provided to list variables or set their values.

## Notepad++ DBGp Plugin {#Notepad++}

A DBGp client is available as a plugin for
[Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) **32-bit**. It is designed
for PHP, but also works with AutoHotkey. The plugin has not been updated
since 2012, and is not available for Notepad++ 64-bit.

**Download:** See [DBGp plugin for
Notepad++](https://sourceforge.net/projects/npp-plugins/files/DBGP%20Plugin/).

**Usage:**

-   Launch Notepad++.

-   Configure the DBGp plugin via *Plugins*, *DBGp*, *Config\...*

    **Note:** File Mapping must be configured. Most users will not be
    debugging remotely, and therefore may simply put a checkmark next to
    *Bypass all mapping (local windows setup)*.

-   Show the debugger pane via the toolbar or **Plugins**, **DBGp**,
    **Debugger**.

-   Open the script file to be debugged.

-   Set at least one breakpoint.

-   Launch AutoHotkey /Debug.

-   Use the debugger toolbar or shortcut keys to control the debugger.

**Features:**

-   Syntax highlighting, if configured by the user.
-   Breakpoints.
-   Run, Step Over/Into/Out, Run to cursor, Stop.
-   View local/global variables.
-   Watch user-specified variables.
-   View the call stack.
-   Hover over a variable to view its contents.
-   User-configurable shortcut keys - Settings, Shortcut Mapper\...,
    Plugin commands.

**Issues:**

-   Hovering over a single-letter variable name does not work - for
    instance, hovering over `a` will attempt to retrieve ` a` or `a `.
-   Hovering over text will attempt to retrieve a variable even if the
    text contains invalid characters.
-   Notepad++ becomes unstable if property_get fails, which is
    particularly problematic in light of the above. As a workaround,
    AutoHotkey sends an empty property instead of an error code when a
    non-existent or invalid variable is requested.

## Script-based Clients {#dbgp.ahk}

A script-based DBGp library and example clients are available from
GitHub.

-   dbgp_console.ahk: Simple command-line client.
-   dbgp_test.ahk: Demonstrates asynchronous debugging.
-   dbgp_listvars.ahk: Example client which justs lists the variables of
    all running scripts.

GitHub: [Lexikos / **dbgp**](https://github.com/Lexikos/dbgp)

The DebugVars script provides a graphical user interface for inspecting
and changing the contents of variables and objects in any running script
(except compiled scripts). It also serves as a demonstration of the
dbgp.ahk library.

GitHub: [Lexikos /
**DebugVars**](https://github.com/Lexikos/DebugVars.ahk#debugvars)

## Command-line Client

A command-line client is available from
[xdebug.org](https://xdebug.org/), however this is not suitable for most
users as it requires a decent understanding of DBGp (the protocol).

## Others

A number of other DBGp clients are available, but have not been tested
with AutoHotkey. For a list, see [Xdebug:
Documentation](https://xdebug.org/docs/remote).
