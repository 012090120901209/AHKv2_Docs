# Creating a Keyboard Macro or Mouse Macro

A macro is a series of scripted actions that is \"played\" upon demand.
The most common activity of a macro is to send [simulated
keystrokes](../lib/Send.htm) and [mouse clicks](../lib/Click.htm) to one
or more windows. Such windows respond to each keystroke and mouse click
as though you had performed it manually, which allows repetitive tasks
to be automated with high speed and reliability.

One of the most convenient ways to play back a macro is to assign it to
a [hotkey](../Hotkeys.htm) or [hotstring](../Hotstrings.htm). For
example, the following hotkey would create an empty e-mail message and
prepare it for a certain type recipient, allowing you to personalize it
prior to sending:

    ^!s::  ; Control+Alt+S hotkey.
    {
        if not WinExist("Inbox - Microsoft Outlook")
            return  ; Outlook isn't open to the right section, so do nothing.
        WinActivate  ; Activate the window found by the above function.
        Send "^n"  ; Create new/blank e-mail via Control+N.
        WinWaitActive "Untitled Message"
        Send "{Tab 2}Product Recall for ACME Rocket Skates"  ; Set the subject line.
        Send "{Tab}Dear Sir or Madam,{Enter 2}We have recently discovered a minor defect ..."  ; etc.
    } ; This brace marks the end of the hotkey.

Hotkey macros like the above are especially useful for tasks you perform
several times per day. By contrast, macros used less often can each be
kept in a separate script accessible by means of a shortcut in the Start
Menu or on the desktop.
