# #SingleInstance

Determines whether a script is allowed to run again when it is already
running.

``` Syntax
#SingleInstance ForceIgnorePromptOff
```

## Parameters {#Parameters}

ForceIgnorePromptOff

:   Type: [String](../Concepts.htm#strings)

    If omitted, it defaults to *Force*. Otherwise, specify one of the
    following words:

    **Force:** Skips the dialog box and replaces the old instance
    automatically, which is similar in effect to the
    [Reload](Reload.htm) function.

    **Ignore:** Skips the dialog box and leaves the old instance
    running. In other words, attempts to launch an already-running
    script are ignored.

    **Prompt:** Displays a dialog box asking whether to keep the old
    instance or replace it with the new one.

    **Off:** Allows multiple instances of the script to run
    concurrently.

## Remarks {#Remarks}

If this directive is unspecified in a script, it will behave as though
set to *Prompt*.

This directive is ignored when any of the following [command line
switches](../Scripts.htm#cmd) are used: /force /restart

Like other directives, #SingleInstance cannot be executed conditionally.

## Limitations {#Limitations}

Previous instances of the script are identified by searching for a [main
window](../Program.htm#main-window) with the [default
title](../Program.htm#title). Therefore, a previous instance may not be
found if:

-   The title of its main window has been changed.
-   It is running on a different version of AutoHotkey.
-   Its main window is no longer top-level, such as if the script has
    used
    [SetParent](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-setparent)
    to change its parent to something other than NULL (0).

At most one previous instance is detected and sent a message asking it
to close. Therefore, the following additional limitations also apply:

-   If there are multiple instances (such as if previous instances of
    the script used the `#SingleInstance Off` mode), the topmost
    matching instance is sent the message, and other instances are not
    considered.
-   If the previous instance is running at a higher integrity level than
    the new instance (where running as administrator \> [running with UI
    access](../Program.htm#Installer_uiAccess) \> normal), it cannot be
    closed due to security restrictions.

If multiple instances of the script are started simultaneously, they may
fail to detect each other or may all target the same previous instance.
This would result in multiple instances of the script starting.
