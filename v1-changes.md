# Changes from v1.0 to v1.1

This document details changes between AutoHotkey v1.0 and v1.1 that may
cause scripts to behave differently, and therefore might be important to
keep in mind while reading or updating old code. See also: [Changes from
v1.1 to v2.0](v2-changes.htm).

AutoHotkey v1.1 is also known as \"AutoHotkey_L\", while AutoHotkey v1.0
was retrospectively labelled \"AutoHotkey Basic\". Some older versions
of AutoHotkey_L used 1.0.\* version numbers, so for clarity, this
document refers to the two branches of AutoHotkey by name rather than
version number.

## Syntax Errors {#Syntax_Errors}

Certain syntax errors which were tolerated by AutoHotkey Basic are not
tolerated by AutoHotkey_L. Most such errors can be easily corrected once
they are identified. Some errors are detected at load-time, and must be
corrected before the script will run at all. Other errors are raised
only when specific conditions are met while the script is running.

Error detection in v2.0 is generally more robust, and as there have been
numerous changes to usage beyond just error detection and handling, the
differences in error detection between v1.0 and v1.1 are not listed
here. For those details, refer to the v1.1 documentation.

## FileRead {#FileRead}

[FileRead](lib/FileRead.htm#Binary) translates text between code pages
in certain common cases and therefore might output corrupt binary data.
To avoid this in v2.0, add the `RAW` option or use
[FileOpen](lib/FileOpen.htm) instead.

## Variable and Function Names {#Names}

The characters `[`, `]` and `?` are reserved for use in
[expressions](Language.htm#expressions), so are no longer valid in
variable names. Consequently, `?` (used in [ternary
operations](Variables.htm#ternary)) no longer requires a space on either
side. Code for v1.0 which uses these characters in a variable name would
have a new interpretation in v1.1, and as such might not be detected as
an error.

## DPI Scaling {#DPIScale}

[DPI scaling](lib/Gui.htm#DPIScale) is enabled by default for script
GUIs to ensure they scale according to the [system DPI
setting](Variables.htm#ScreenDPI). If enabled and the system DPI setting
is not 96 (100 %), positions and sizes accepted by or returned from Gui
methods/properties are not compatible with other functions. To disable
DPI scaling, use `MyGui.Opt("-DPIScale")`.

## Transform {#Transform}

Some *Transform* sub-commands are altered or unavailable:

-   *Transform Unicode* is available only in ANSI versions of
    AutoHotkey. To assign Unicode text to the clipboard, use a regular
    assignment. See also:
    [StrPut](lib/StrPut.htm)/[StrGet](lib/StrGet.htm).
-   *Transform HTML* supports additional features in Unicode versions of
    AutoHotkey_L.

*Transform* itself was removed in v2.0.

## Default Script {#Default_Script}

When AutoHotkey_L is launched without specifying a script, an .ahk file
is loaded by default instead of an .ini file. The name of this file
depends on the filename of the current executable. For more details, see
[Script Filename](Scripts.htm#defaultfile).

## SetFormat, Integer\[Fast\], H {#SetFormat}

When an uppercase H is used, hexadecimal digits A-F will also be in
uppercase. AutoHotkey Basic always produces lowercase digits.

*SetFormat* itself was removed in v2.0. `Format("0x{:x}", n)` produces
lowercase a-f while `Format("0x{:X}", n)` produces uppercase A-F.

## A_LastError {#LastError}

The following commands now set [A_LastError](Variables.htm#LastError) to
assist with debugging: FileAppend, FileRead, FileReadLine, FileDelete,
FileCopy, FileMove, FileGetAttrib/Time/Size/Version, FileSetAttrib/Time,
FileCreateDir, RegRead, RegWrite, RegDelete. Using any of these commands
causes the previous value of A_LastError to be overwritten.

For v2.0, A_LastError is also set by IniRead, IniWrite and IniDelete.

## MsgBox {#MsgBox}

MsgBox in v1.0 and v1.1 had \"smart comma handling\" to avoid the need
to escape commas in unquoted text. This handling was slightly different
between the two versions, and might need to be taken into account in
very rare cases while reading v1.0 code. Refer to the v1.1 documentation
for details. v2.0 uses expression syntax exclusively and as such has no
need for any special handling of commas.

## Gui +Owner {#GuiOwner}

Applying the [+Owner](lib/Gui.htm#Owner) option to a Gui also removes
the WS_CHILD style and sets the WS_POPUP style. This may break scripts
which used `+Owner` to set the parent window of a Gui *after* setting
the styles.

## \~Tilde and Custom Combination Hotkeys {#Tilde}

As of v1.1.14, the [tilde prefix](Hotkeys.htm#Tilde) affects how a key
works when used as a modifier key in a custom combination.

## Custom Combinations and Down/Up Hotkeys {#ComboUpDown}

Except when the tilde prefix is used, if both a key-down and a key-up
hotkey are defined for a custom modifier key, they will both fire when
the key is released. For example, `x & y::` causes both `x::` and
`x up::` to fire when x is released, where previously `x::` never fired.

## If Var is \[not\] Type {#IfIs}

*If Var is \[not\] Type* identified certain (possibly locale-specific)
non-ASCII characters as alphabetic/uppercase/lowercase by default in
v1.0, whereas it did so in v1.1 only if *StringCaseSense Locale* was
used. Similarly, the [Is*Type*](lib/Is.htm) functions in v2.0 only
identify non-ASCII characters as alphabetic if the second parameter is
`"Locale"`.

## Window Groups {#Window_Groups}

[GroupActivate](lib/GroupActivate.htm) sets ErrorLevel only in v1.1, not
v1.0 or v2.0.

[GroupAdd](lib/GroupAdd.htm)\'s *Label* parameter behaves differently
between v1.0 and v1.1, but was removed in v2.0.

## Run / RunWait {#Run}

AutoHotkey_L includes some enhancements to the way the
[Run](lib/Run.htm) and [RunWait](lib/Run.htm) commands interpret the
*Target* parameter. This allows some things that didn\'t work
previously, but in some very rare cases, may also affect scripts which
were already working in AutoHotkey Basic. The new behaviour is as
follows:

-   If *Target* begins with a quotation mark, everything up to the next
    quotation mark is considered the action, typically an executable
    file.
-   Otherwise the first substring which ends at a space and is either an
    existing file or ends in .exe, .bat, .com, .cmd or .hta is
    considered the action. This allows file types such as .ahk, .vbs or
    .lnk to accept parameters while still allowing \"known\" executables
    such as wordpad.exe to be launched without an absolute path as in
    previous versions.

## Control-Z {#ControlZ}

[Loop Read](lib/LoopRead.htm) and [File.ReadLine](lib/File.htm#ReadLine)
no longer interpret the character [Ctrl]{.kbd}+[Z]{.kbd} (0x1A) as an
end-of-file marker. Any [Ctrl]{.kbd}+[Z]{.kbd}, even one appearing at
the very end of the file, is loaded as-is. [FileRead](lib/FileRead.htm)
already ignored this character, so is not affected by this issue.

## A_IsCompiled {#IsCompiled}

If the script has not been compiled,
[A_IsCompiled](Variables.htm#IsCompiled) is defined even if the script
has not been compiled; its value is `""` in v1.1 and `0` in v2.0.
Previously it was left undefined, which meant that assignments such as
`A_IsCompiled := 1` were valid if the script hadn\'t been compiled. Now
it is treated as a read-only built-in variable in all cases.

## DllCall {#DllCall}

When the function name given to [DllCall](lib/DllCall.htm) cannot be
resolved, AutoHotkey_L automatically appends an \"A\" (ANSI) or \"W\"
(Unicode) to the function name regardless of which DLL was specified. By
contrast, AutoHotkey Basic appends the \"A\" suffix only for functions
in User32.dll, Kernel32.dll, ComCtl32.dll, or Gdi32.dll.
