# FileSetTime

Changes the datetime stamp of one or more files or folders. Wildcards
are supported.

``` Syntax
FileSetTime YYYYMMDDHH24MISS, FilePattern, WhichTime, Mode
```

## Parameters {#Parameters}

YYYYMMDDHH24MISS

:   Type: [String](../Concepts.htm#strings)

    If blank or omitted, it defaults to the current local date and time.
    Otherwise, specify the time to use for the operation (see
    [Remarks](#Remarks) for the format). Years prior to 1601 are not
    supported.

FilePattern

:   Type: [String](../Concepts.htm#strings)

    If omitted, the current file of the innermost enclosing [file
    loop](LoopFiles.htm) will be used. Otherwise, specify the name of a
    single file or folder, or a wildcard pattern such as
    `"C:\Temp\*.tmp"`. *FilePattern* is assumed to be in
    [A_WorkingDir](../Variables.htm#WorkingDir) if an absolute path
    isn\'t specified.

    Both asterisks (`*`) and question marks (`?`) are supported as
    wildcards. `*` matches zero or more characters and `?` matches any
    single character. Usage examples:

    -   `*.*` or `*` matches all files.
    -   `*.htm` matches files with the extension .htm, .html, etc.
    -   `*.` matches files without an extension.
    -   `log?.txt` matches e.g. log1.txt but not log10.txt.
    -   `*report*` matches any filename containing the word \"report\".

WhichTime

:   Type: [String](../Concepts.htm#strings)

    If blank or omitted, it defaults to M. Otherwise, specify one of the
    following letters to set which timestamp should be changed:

    -   M = Modification time
    -   C = Creation time
    -   A = Last access time

Mode

:   Type: [String](../Concepts.htm#strings)

    If blank or omitted, only files are operated upon and subdirectories
    are not recursed into. Otherwise, specify one or more of the
    following letters:

    -   D = Include directories (folders).
    -   F = Include files. If both F and D are omitted, files are
        included but not folders.
    -   R = Subfolders are recursed into so that files and folders
        contained therein are operated upon if they match *FilePattern*.
        All subfolders will be recursed into, not just those whose names
        match *FilePattern*. If R is omitted, files and folders in
        subfolders are not included.

    **Note:** If *FilePattern* is a single folder rather than a wildcard
    pattern, it will always be operated upon regardless of this setting.

## Error Handling {#Error_Handling}

An [Error](Error.htm) is thrown if any files failed to be changed, with
its [Extra](Error.htm#Extra) property set to the number of failures.

If files were found, [A_LastError](../Variables.htm#LastError) is set to
0 (zero) or the result of the operating system\'s GetLastError()
function immediately after the last failure. Otherwise A_LastError
contains an error code that might indicate why no files were found.

## Remarks {#Remarks}

A file\'s last access time might not be as precise on FAT16 & FAT32
volumes as it is on NTFS volumes.

The elements of the YYYYMMDDHH24MISS format are:

  Element   Description
  --------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  YYYY      The 4-digit year
  MM        The 2-digit month (01-12)
  DD        The 2-digit day of the month (01-31)
  HH24      The 2-digit hour in 24-hour format (00-23). For example, 09 is 9am and 21 is 9pm.
  MI        The 2-digit minutes (00-59)
  SS        The 2-digit seconds (00-59)

If only a partial string is given for YYYYMMDDHH24MISS (e.g. 200403),
any remaining element that has been omitted will be supplied with the
following default values:

-   MM = Month 01
-   DD = Day 01
-   HH24 = Hour 00
-   MI = Minute 00
-   SS = Second 00

The built-in variable [A_Now](../Variables.htm#Now) contains the current
local time in the above format. Similarly,
[A_NowUTC](../Variables.htm#NowUTC) contains the current Coordinated
Universal Time.

**Note:** Date-time values can be compared, added to, or subtracted from
via [DateAdd](DateAdd.htm) and [DateDiff](DateDiff.htm). Also, it is
best to not use greater-than or less-than to compare times unless they
are both the same string length. This is because they would be compared
as numbers; for example, 20040201 is always numerically less (but
chronologically greater) than 200401010533. So instead use
[DateDiff](DateDiff.htm) to find out whether the amount of time between
them is positive or negative.

## Examples {#Examples}

::: {#ExOmitted .ex}
[](#ExOmitted){.ex_number} Sets the modification time to the current
time for all matching files.

    FileSetTime "", "C:\temp\*.txt"
:::

::: {#ExModTime .ex}
[](#ExModTime){.ex_number} Sets the modification date (time will be
midnight).

    FileSetTime 20040122, "C:\My Documents\test.doc"
:::

::: {#ExCreateTime .ex}
[](#ExCreateTime){.ex_number} Sets the creation date. The time will be
set to 4:55pm.

    FileSetTime 200401221655, "C:\My Documents\test.doc", "C"
:::

::: {#ExPattern .ex}
[](#ExPattern){.ex_number} Changes the mod-date of all files that match
a pattern. Any matching folders will also be changed due to the last
parameter.
